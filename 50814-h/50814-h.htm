<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>The rules for disposing of the proceeds of prizes
captured in war is a question of municipal law. After a prize
has been legally condemned, international law has no direct
concern with the ultimate disposition which the captor state may
choose to make of the proceeds. Indirectly, however, the prize
money laws of different states may be of great interest to other
states, for the character of the internal regulations in this
matter may determine the amount of energy displayed by cruisers
in making captures; the impartiality of national prize tribunals,
the number of prizes and the number of condemnations made in a
particular war; questions of vital interest to both belligerent
and neutral merchantmen plying their trade on the high seas in
time of war.</p>

<p>It is the purpose of this paper to investigate the
character of prize money laws in force in various countries at
different periods of their history, the conditions which have
given rise to such rules, and the effect particular rules have
had upon maritime captures in time of war.</p>

<h3><a name="Part11" id="Part11"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART 1. GREECE.</a></h3>


<h4>a. Land War.</h4>

<p>The Greeks are possibly the earliest people who
attained a sufficient degree of civilization to have any definite
laws of war, consequently we shall first look to them for laws
of prize distribution. In his chapter on "the right of acquiring
things captured in war",<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Grotius treats at length the condition
of private property in war among the ancients. His remarks are
intended to refer to both land and naval warfare though in fact
all his instances are drawn from land warfare. It is probable
that the same theories applied in both cases though on the high
seas from the nature of the case, the state would have much
greater difficulty in enforcing any restrictions upon the right
of making captures and appropriating the profits therefrom than
on land.</p>

<p>In regard to the Greek treatment of prize, Grotius
says:<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"After the battle of Plataea there was a severe edict
that no one should privately take any part of the booty.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Afterwards when Athens was conquered the booty was made public
property by Lysander<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and the Spartan officers who had to deal
with the measure were called prize sellers.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> If we go to Asia
the Trojans were accustomed as Virgil teaches to draw prize lots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>as is done in dividing common property.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In other cases the
decision of the matter was with the general and by this right
Hector promises Dolon the horses of Achilles when he stipulates
for them,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> by which you may see that the right of prize
treasure was not in the captor alone. So when Cyrus was victor,
the booty was taken to him,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and when Alexander, to him."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>In his work on International law among the ancients,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Phillipson has presented similar instances of the distribution
of booty. He adds to the statement made by Grotius in regard
to the battle of Plataea that after making proclamation that
no one should take the booty "Pausanias ordered the helots to
collect the treasure of which one tithe was allotted to the
Gods at Delphi, another to the Olympian God, and a third to the
God at the Isthmus, and the rest was divided according to title
and merit. An additional reward was also given to those who
particularly distinguished themselves, and a special portion
reserved for Pausanias."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and again, "In 426 B.C. when
Ambracia was reduced by the Acaranians with the help of the
Athenians under Demosthenes, a third part of the spoils was
assigned to Athens, three hundred panoplies to Demosthenes and
the remainder divided by the Acaranians among their cities."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Similar practices have been noted by Prof. Amos S.
Hershey in a recent article. He says "It was customary to
divide the booty amongst the victorious soldiery, i.e. after
devoting one tenth of the spoil to the Gods and a portion to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>leaders and warriors who had particularly distinguished themselves."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The Greeks also appear to have recognized the right
of reprisal. Thus in the Iliad, Nestor speaks of making
reprisals on the Epeian nation, in satisfaction for a prize won
by his father Neleus at the Elian games and for debts due to
many private subjects of the Pylian kingdom. The booty was
equitably divided among the many creditors.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>This testimony is based on the writings of Herodotus,
Plutarch, Xenophon, Homer, Virgil, Pliny and other classical
writers. It has little bearing on our present subject except in so
far as it indicates the recognition even at so early an age of
the principle that the title to captured property does not rest
in the immediate captor but that proceeds of prize shall be
equitably divided by the general or other officer. In the case
of the battle of Plataea there seems to be also a recognition
of the principle that prizes of right belong to the whole public,
in other words to the state.</p>

<p>These two principles, that prizes do not belong to
the original captor but should be divided, and that the state
may appropriate prizes seem to constitute the Greek theory on
the subject. It is unlikely that they were the subject of
definite laws but recognition was given to them if at all by
command of the general on the occasion of a particular war, as
is indicated in the cases cited.</p>

<p>The basis for this theory, apparently far ahead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>its time may be found in the well developed feeling of political
obligation among the Greeks. They appear to have recognized
public war as a state affair, consequently individual soldiers
acted only in the capacity of agents of the state in regular
military operations.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Their captures accrued not to themselves
but to the state for whom they acted.</p>

<p>Of the actual effect of such a prize law among the
Greeks it is difficult to make a statement. It might be supposed
that the incentive toward the capture of booty would be
decreased by such a rule yet so far as we can learn of Greek
warfare there was no limit to the atrocities committed either
on persons or property.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The Greek soldier felt justified in
going to any extreme in acting for his state.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>


<h4>b. Maritime War.</h4>

<p>Grotius has nothing to say of prize laws in maritime
warfare. Phillipson believes that the Greeks made prize of
enemy vessels and also of neutral vessels for breach of blockade.
He gives evidence which indicates that theoretically, confiscable
goods went to the state, and that rudimentary prize courts were
held. Thus he says:</p>

<p>"In most Greek states there was something of the
nature of a prize court, to which appeals could be made by those
who held they had been contrary to the law of nations deprived
of their property. In Athens, the assembly of the people
frequently took cognizance of such claims. Thus two trierarchs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>were accused of appropriating the proceeds of a cargo from
Naucrates on the ground that if confiscable it ought to have
gone to the State. An assembly was therefore held and the people
voted for a hearing on the question."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> But in general, law
at sea was very poorly enforced and neutral rights seldom
respected. In fact it seems likely that maritime war fell
little short of piracy so far as the capture of private property
was concerned.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Thus Polycrates of Samos wishing to establish
his supremacy on the Aegean built up a navy which swept the
sea, robbing friend and foe alike,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and so "at the commencement
of the Peloponnesian war the Lacedaemonians captured not only
the trading vessels of their enemy the Athenians, and also of
their allies, but even those of neutral states and all who
were taken on board were treated as enemies and indiscriminately
slaughtered."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The Aegean sea was a nest of pirates and the
profession was looked upon not only as a legitimate means of
emolument but was even considered glorious.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> They were
frequently engaged in war as mercenaries. Thus Psammilicha was
reinforced by Carian and Ionian pirates,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Euripidas and Aelotian
employed pirates as mercenaries in 218 B.C.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and Polyxenidas
the commander of the fleet of Antiocha entered into an alliance
with Nicander, a pirate chief who contributed five decked ships
in 190 B.C.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> In such cases of course the state surrendered all
right in controlling the distribution of prize money or of
itself sharing in the proceeds.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>The Rhodian sea laws<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> are said to have been effective
in the third century B.C. in temporarily freeing the sea of
Pirates<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and giving opportunity for considerable commercial
advancement. Unfortunately these laws have been almost entirely
lost so we do not know what measures were taken for disposing of
the captured pirate vessels or other enemy goods that might be
considered prize.</p>

<p>It seems that the theory of the states control over
prize applied in naval as in land war but that in practice
government authority at no period of ancient Greek history
extended very effectively over the seas for any considerable
length of time and that private property was for the most part
at the tender mercies of the pirates.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_2_ROME" id="PART_2_ROME"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART 2. ROME.</a></h3>

<h4>a. Land War.</h4>

<p>From the Greek theories the Roman legal mind
developed elaborate rules for the apportionment of booty
captured in land war. The Romans clearly recognized that the
prizes taken in public war belong to the state.</p>

<p>"Whatever is captured from the enemy, the law directs
to be public property: so that not only private persons are
not the owners of it, but even the general is not. The Questor
takes it, sells it and carries the money to the public account."
says Dionysius of Halicarnassus.<a name="FNanchor_1_28" id="FNanchor_1_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_28" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This might seem to imply
that no individual could enjoy a share of the proceeds but
such does not seem to have been the case. It simply means that
the title to all captures vested in the state which could if it
saw fit transfer a share of the booty to the captors or others.
Grotius<a name="FNanchor_2_29" id="FNanchor_2_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_29" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> gives definite rules employed by the Romans in dividing
the produce of such booty. His statements are based on the
writings of Livy and other Latin writers.</p>

<p>In dividing booty money account was taken of the pay
of the soldiers and of special bravery.<a name="FNanchor_3_30" id="FNanchor_3_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_30" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Special reward was
usually made to the general.<a name="FNanchor_4_31" id="FNanchor_4_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_31" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Sometimes a portion was given to
others who had contributed to the expenses of the war.<a name="FNanchor_5_32" id="FNanchor_5_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_32" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Often
a portion was dedicated to the Gods<a name="FNanchor_6_33" id="FNanchor_6_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_33" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> although this practice was
much less common among them than among the Greeks. It was
considered a particularly worthy act on the part of a general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>if he refused to accept any share of the booty as was sometimes
done by those seeking state honors.<a name="FNanchor_7_34" id="FNanchor_7_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_34" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The whole system was
closely circumscribed by law. A penalty attached to the crime
of peculation, the private secreting of booty without submitting
it to the public.<a name="FNanchor_8_35" id="FNanchor_8_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_35" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Roman orators dilated at length on the infamy
of peculation.<a name="FNanchor_9_36" id="FNanchor_9_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_36" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>These rules applied only to soldiers of the regular
army engaged in regular war. In irregular warfare soldiers
were often given the privilege of committing indiscriminate
pillage in which case the booty belonged to the captor.<a name="FNanchor_10_37" id="FNanchor_10_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_37" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This
practice however was greatly deplored by many writers.<a name="FNanchor_11_38" id="FNanchor_11_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_38" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Captures
made by allies not under the immediate commands of Roman generals
or by subjects carrying on war without pay at their own risk
accrued to the sole benefit of the captors.<a name="FNanchor_12_39" id="FNanchor_12_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_39" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>


<h4>b. Maritime War.</h4>

<p>As to captures at sea, the Jurisconsult Valneius
Maecianus said, "I am master of the earth, but the law is mistress
of the sea."<a name="FNanchor_13_40" id="FNanchor_13_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_40" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Grotius has nothing to say directly of maritime
captures among the Romans, though he implies that the same laws
applied to them as to land captures. A case of naval prize
arose during the Punic war in the capture of the Carthaginian
woman, Saphonoba, from a vessel at sea. The Roman general
considered that all prize of war belonged to the Roman people
and was to be divided by the senate, so ordered that she be sent
to Rome. The lady settled the matter by taking poison.<a name="FNanchor_14_41" id="FNanchor_14_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_41" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p>The Romans were a land people. They very much disliked
naval warfare,<a name="FNanchor_15_42" id="FNanchor_15_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_42" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> consequently they never supported much of a
fleet.<a name="FNanchor_16_43" id="FNanchor_16_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_43" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> True, on meeting a naval power like Carthage they
created a very effective navy on short notice<a name="FNanchor_17_44" id="FNanchor_17_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_44" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> but whenever they
could they avoided naval warfare. Piracy was extremely prevalent
on the Mediterranean during Roman times. Often Roman generals
made use of pirate vessels both for transport and to harass
the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_18_45" id="FNanchor_18_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_45" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In these cases of course the state put up no claim
to control prizes. Later, pirates became so powerful that Rome
saw the necessity of crushing them. Servilius actively engaged
in suppressing piracy and he felt bound to render full account
to Rome of all captures.<a name="FNanchor_19_46" id="FNanchor_19_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_46" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Pompey finally crushed the pirates
in the battle of Coracesum B.C. 67 and completely drove them
out of the Mediterranean.<a name="FNanchor_20_47" id="FNanchor_20_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_47" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The Romans recognized the right of
reprisal and according to Chancellor Kent they required the
carriage of a commission by vessels engaged in that business.<a name="FNanchor_21_48" id="FNanchor_21_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_48" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Roman law, then, recognized that captures were the
property of the state, that apportionment should be governed by
law, that in special cases the state could waive all right in
favor of the immediate captors.</p>

<p>Rome's policy was directed toward the securing of
order through law. Discipline and authority were the fundamental
principles on which her greatness was founded. Her military
policy was to subordinate individuals to the general good, to
make each soldier a cog in the wheel working in harmony with
the whole. Individual freedom of action was curtailed not in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>the interests of humanity but in the interests of the efficiency
of the general army. Her rules of prize distribution are
completely in harmony with these principles. No private right
of aggrandizement in war existed, all was controlled by the
state. The state was the combatant in war, the state bore the
losses and to the state accrued the gains. State authority
overshadowed every act of the individual.<a name="FNanchor_22_49" id="FNanchor_22_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_49" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>In practical effects the Roman laws of prize money
probably accomplished the purpose for which they were intended,
that is, they lessened the chance for insubordination among the
soldiers. Under them soldiers remained at their post of duty
instead of going on journeys of pillage. It made war regular
and public instead of guerrilla and private.</p>

<p>Humanitarian effects were slight or none at all.
Though not impelled by the hope of personal gain the Roman
soldiers seem to have captured, devastated and destroyed without
compunction. Wheaton says of Roman warfare, "Victory made even
the sacred things of the enemy profane, confiscated all his
property, moveable and immoveable, public and private, doomed
him and his posterity to perpetual slavery and dragged his kings
and generals at the chariot wheels of the conqueror thus
depressing an enemy in his spirit and pride of mind, the only
consolation he has left when his strength and power are
annihilated."<a name="FNanchor_23_50" id="FNanchor_23_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_50" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Though Roman warfare was cruel, it was regulated by law.
Roman civilization recognized the supremacy of the state, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>public character of regular war, and of immediate interest to
the present subject, the exclusive control by the state of all
military captures.</p>

<h3><a name="Part21" id="Part21"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART 1. MARITIME CODES.</a></h3>


<p>"In the dark ages, between 476 and 800 A.D.
International law reached its nadir in the West".<a name="FNanchor_1_51" id="FNanchor_1_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_51" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Private war,
on land and piracy at sea were unrestrained. There were of
course no laws providing for the division of prize money.</p>

<p>By the eleventh and twelfth centuries many cities
of the Mediterranean and North seas had become powerful
commercially and issued laws for determining maritime affairs.
Such were the Amalfitan Tables, the Judgments or Roles of Oleron,
the Laws of Wisby, and the Consolato del Mare originating in
Barcelona.<a name="FNanchor_2_52" id="FNanchor_2_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_52" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> As these laws simply stated the universal customs
of the sea it came about that all maritime towns would adopt one
of these codes.<a name="FNanchor_3_53" id="FNanchor_3_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_53" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Thus by the fifteenth century the Consolato
del Mare was recognized maritime law in most of the commercial
cities of the Mediterranean<a name="FNanchor_4_54" id="FNanchor_4_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_54" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> while the Judgments of Oleron
were in a similar way recognized by the towns of the North Sea.<a name="FNanchor_5_55" id="FNanchor_5_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_55" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
These laws were intended primarily to regulate the private
relations of mariners, owners and merchants, but on account of
the necessity of protection from pirates many of them also
included laws of maritime war and prize. State organization
had not developed sufficiently to afford protection to merchants
on the sea, consequently the merchants themselves formed
protective organizations, furnished armed cruisers for making
prizes and established consulates for judging maritime cases and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>for enforcing the definite codes of maritime law.<a name="FNanchor_6_56" id="FNanchor_6_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_56" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The Consolato Del Mare may be taken as an example
of the maritime codes. It probably originated in the thirteenth
century. The earliest known manuscripts are in the Catalonian
language and apparently were engrossed in the middle of the
fourteenth century. The earliest printed copy is dated 1494 and
is also in the Catalonian language.<a name="FNanchor_7_57" id="FNanchor_7_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_57" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The chapters on prize law,
state the principles on which enemy property may be captured.
In general the principle is established that enemy vessels and
neutral goods are exempt. Originally the armed merchantmen were
in no way bound to any state so no commission delegating state
authority to make captures is mentioned. Apparently the prizes
had to be adjudicated at the consulates established by the
merchant leagues.<a name="FNanchor_8_58" id="FNanchor_8_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_58" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>There are chapters dealing with "cruizers" which give
the municipal usages concerning the distribution of prize between
the owners, officers and crew of vessels.<a name="FNanchor_9_59" id="FNanchor_9_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_59" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>"Thus among the Italians a third part of a captured
ship goes to the captain of the victorious ship, a third part to
the merchants to whom the cargo belonged, and a third part to
the sailors".<a name="FNanchor_10_60" id="FNanchor_10_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_60" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>It thus appears that the Consolato distinctly
recognized the reign of law in prize matters. It respected
neutral rights, it required adjudication on prizes, it gave
rules for the division of prize money, respecting the claims
of merchants, captain and crew to share in the distribution.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>The rules of the Consolato appeal to one decidedly
as rules intended to govern commercial enterprises. The policy
of the merchants was of defensive rather than offensive war so
no stringent belligerent rights were affirmed. Primarily
intended for commerce, it is not surprising that such a large
amount of respect was paid to neutral rights and such a large
share of the prizes given to merchants. The minute rules,
seemingly forecasting every possible contingency also speak of
a strong desire to establish order, and firm law, both conditions
essential to commerce.</p>

<p>The Consolato was probably effective for its purpose.
We know that the merchant guilds and the maritime towns flourished,
piracy decreased, commerce prospered. The merchant sailors would
not be likely to be lured into making prizes for private gain
when their very object was the destruction of piracy. Also
habits of commerce and obedience to law would induce them to
exhibit moderation in war matters. The maritime laws and the
supremacy of the commercial towns was a great step toward
legalizing maritime warfare and especially toward ameliorating
the condition of private property on the sea.</p>

<p>One of the peculiarities of the Consolato from a
modern standpoint is that it does not recognize the exclusive
right of states to make war. This is explained by the fact that
territorial states had not become sufficiently centralized to
organize a definite maritime jurisdiction. However, in the early
part of the sixteenth century the movement toward the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>individualizing of territorial states was rapidly nearing
completion and it is interesting to note that when the movement
was sufficiently advanced nearly all the states adopted one of
the old maritime codes into their laws, of course adding to it
the principle of state authorization for all reprisals or wars
and state jurisdiction over prize cases.<a name="FNanchor_11_61" id="FNanchor_11_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_61" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<h3><a name="PART_2_THE_NEW_INTERNATIONAL_LAW" id="PART_2_THE_NEW_INTERNATIONAL_LAW"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART 2. THE NEW INTERNATIONAL LAW.</a></h3>


<p>During the sixteenth century the idea of the
individuality of territorial states reached material realization.
A school of international law writers arose who endeavored to
determine the relations which ought to exist between these states.
A new recognition was given to the state's exclusive authority
over matters of war and prize. The old Roman laws of JusGentium
and JusNaturale were combined with the observed practices of
nations to build up rules conformable to the new situation.</p>

<p>Machiavelli writing in 1513<a name="FNanchor_1_62" id="FNanchor_1_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_62" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> distinctly recognized
the independence of the territorial state.<a name="FNanchor_2_63" id="FNanchor_2_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_63" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He conceived of the
Prince as being under obligations to no superior, either human
or divine.<a name="FNanchor_3_64" id="FNanchor_3_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_64" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He recognized the state as the sole agency which
could authorize war and the capture of prize but recommended
liberality in distributing the produce of prize and booty as a
policy calculated to encourage loyalty and perseverance in the
soldiers,<a name="FNanchor_4_65" id="FNanchor_4_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_65" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> a theory well in harmony with his idea of human nature,
which considered man as actuated solely by the hope of personal
gain.<a name="FNanchor_5_66" id="FNanchor_5_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_66" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Conrad Brunus in 1548 also voiced the theory of
state supremacy in war. "The war making power resides in the
supreme authority of the state to whom it exclusively belongs to
authorize hostilities against other nations by a solemn
declaration."<a name="FNanchor_6_67" id="FNanchor_6_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_67" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Francis de Victoria held that captured moveables
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>become by the law of nations property of the captors but pillage
should be only permitted when necessary for reducing the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_7_68" id="FNanchor_7_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_68" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Balthazar Ayala took an even more advanced stand.
He pointed out that according to the laws of Spain, lands, houses
and ships of war taken from the enemy become the property of the
crown and as to other articles the right of the captors to
appropriate them as booty is restrained by that of the state to
regulate the division reserving to itself a certain share and
distributing the rest according to the respective rank of the
captors. In regard to naval captures he says:</p>

<p>"But if it chance that in naval war the king supplies
the ships and their armament and also provides supplies and wages
for the soldiers and sailors the same contributions place the
whole booty at the disposal not of the general or admiral but of
the king, nor will the soldiers or sailors get any part thereof
except such as is granted to them by the king's liberality. In
every other event however, after the king's share has been set
aside, the admiral can divide the residue between the soldiers and
sailors a seventh part of the residue being due to himself".<a name="FNanchor_8_69" id="FNanchor_8_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_69" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Ayala had previously remarked that by the Spanish law the king's
share ranged from one fifth to one half of the prize. In his
theory goods must be brought within the territory of the
capturing state (intra praesidia) to give a good title. If
recaptured before this, by postliminium, they revert to the
original owner. Reprisals must be authorized by the sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_9_70" id="FNanchor_9_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_70" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Thomas More conceived of a liberal policy of disposing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>of prize, in his Utopia. In speaking of the capture of cities he
says, "If they knowe that annye cytezeins counselled to yealde
and rendre vp the citie, to them they gyue parts of the condemned
mens goods. They resydewe they distribute and giue frelye
amonge them, whose helpe they had in the same warre. For none
of themselfes taketh any portion of the praye."<a name="FNanchor_10_71" id="FNanchor_10_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_71" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Bodin clearly enunciated the sovereigns exclusive
right over sea captures. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais les droits de la mer n'appartienment
qu'au Prince Souverain.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_11_72" id="FNanchor_11_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_72" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Gentilis the forerunner of Grotius expressed the
limitations on the power of the state. There was danger that in
the rise of states to independence the Machiavellian policy would
be adopted, that states would consider themselves bound by no law.
Gentilis showed the limitations that natural law impose upon states
even in war. In his view, property can not be wantonly destroyed,
neutral property can never be captured and neutral territory is
always inviolable.<a name="FNanchor_12_73" id="FNanchor_12_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_73" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In his epoch making work which appeared in 1625,
Grotius correlates the principles of those preceding him and in
authoritative style sets forth the new international law.<a name="FNanchor_13_74" id="FNanchor_13_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_74" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> His
chapters on prize distribution may be briefly summarized as follows:
The right of reprisal is recognized but it is only allowable under
authority of the state. In the case of reprisals the property
in goods taken immediately accrues to the captor to the extent
of the debt or damages due and expenses, but any balance over
this ought to be restored. The prize should be adjudged in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>court of the state before distribution.<a name="FNanchor_14_75" id="FNanchor_14_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_75" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Goods captured at
sea require firm possession to give a title. In Roman law this
is established when the vessel is brought to port (intra praesidia),
but modern practice establishes the twenty four hour rule.
Recaptures, before possession is established, revert to the original
owner by postliminium.<a name="FNanchor_15_76" id="FNanchor_15_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_76" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Neutral property is never subject to
capture not even in enemy ships. Enemy property is good prize.
If taken otherwise than in regular public service, i.e. in
private reprisals, or under special grant of pillage, it becomes
the property of the immediate captor though the municipal law of
the captors state may alter this condition. Goods taken in
public service accrue to the state which may distribute the
proceeds at will.<a name="FNanchor_16_77" id="FNanchor_16_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_77" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Instances are given of the distribution laws
in contemporary states. "Among the Italians a third part of a
captured ship goes to the captain of the victorious ship, a third
part to the merchants to whom the cargo belonged and a third part
to the sailors."<a name="FNanchor_17_78" id="FNanchor_17_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_78" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> "With the Spaniards, if ships are sent out at
private expense, part of the prize goes to the king, part to the
high admiral,<a name="FNanchor_18_79" id="FNanchor_18_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_79" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and ships of war go altogether to the king."<a name="FNanchor_19_80" id="FNanchor_19_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_80" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
By the custom of France, the Admiral has a tenth,<a name="FNanchor_20_81" id="FNanchor_20_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_81" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and so with
the Hollanders but here a fifth part of the booty is taken by
the state.<a name="FNanchor_21_82" id="FNanchor_21_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_82" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Zouche of Oxford University, England, in 1650 made a
valuable contribution to international law literature in his
"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Juris et Judicii Fecialis sive Juris Inter gentes Explicatia</span>",
a book famed as being the first to describe the science as <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>inter gentes</span>, international law, rather than the former misleading
name, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus gentium</span>, law of nations. He maintains that war can
only be declared by the supreme authority of the state. However
if acts of aggression are committed by individuals during war
without authorization, international law has no jurisdiction over
the matter, though municipal law may decree punishment.<a name="FNanchor_22_83" id="FNanchor_22_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_83" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> As
coming from England this theory is interesting as it seems to
forecast the later doctrine of that country that unauthorized
captures at sea are permissible so far as the enemy is concerned
though municipal law decrees the whole product of such captures
to the crown.<a name="FNanchor_23_84" id="FNanchor_23_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_84" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Zouche admits the right of reprisal. By reprisal
is understood the right assumed by a subject to collect a foreign
debt or to collect damages for injuries received in a foreign
country through the seizure of goods on the high seas belonging
to any subject of that state. Though the practice seems hard to
reconcile with justice, Zouche in common with most of the
international law writers holds that all the members of a state
are liable for the debts of one member so by strict international
law, reprisal is allowable but only under commission from the
sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_24_85" id="FNanchor_24_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_85" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Puffendorf writing in 1672 practically quotes the
views of Grotius in prize matters.<a name="FNanchor_25_86" id="FNanchor_25_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_86" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He maintains that
individuals can not make war, which is only a state affair, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il
est certain, que c'est au souverain seul qu'appartient le droit
de faire la guerre.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_26_87" id="FNanchor_26_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_87" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In regard to captures he holds that the
title to booty vests originally in the sovereign but it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>equitable for the sovereign to divide the proceeds among those
who have borne the heaviest burdens of war. Recaptures revert
to the original owner. The right of reprisals is admitted but
exception is taken to the view of Grotius that in case of
reprisals and all captures made by private undertaking the
proceeds belong immediately to the captor. Puffendorf asserts
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tout le droit que les particuliers ant ici depend toujours
originairement de la volonte du souverain</span>,"<a name="FNanchor_27_88" id="FNanchor_27_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_88" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> thus emphasizing
more strongly the absolute title of the state to all captures.
A careful reading of Grotius seems to reveal that his idea was
the same. He says that by the practice of nations captures not
made in regular war usually accrue to the captor but this rule
may be changed by municipal law and "so a rule may be introduced
by law that all things which are taken from the enemy shall be
public property,"<a name="FNanchor_28_89" id="FNanchor_28_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_89" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> thus virtually asserting Puffendorf's
statement that the original title always vests in the sovereign.</p>

<p>In brief the laws of prize distribution enunciated
by the great founders of international law of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries appear to be as follows:</p>

<p>1. The state is the only power which can prosecute
war and make prize.</p>

<p>2. The right of private reprisal can only be exercised
under specific commission from the state.</p>

<p>3. The title to all prizes vests originally in the
state.</p>

<p>4. Distribution should be decreed only after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>adjudication of the prize by a regular tribunal of the state.</p>

<p>5. The method of distributing prize money is
determined by municipal law.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the practice of nations did not, in a
great many cases equal the lofty ideals of the publicists but at
the same time their principles were for the most part given
theoretic recognition by the sovereign authorities of states
belonging to the family of nations and as centralized authority
gained in strength they became more and more realized in practice.</p>

<h4>a. Laws.</h4>

<p>The practice of Great Britain in prize distribution
has always been remarkable for its extreme liberality to the
captors of prize. Chancellor Kent has a note to the effect that
by common law "goods taken from an enemy belong to the captor."<a name="FNanchor_1_90" id="FNanchor_1_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_90" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
His authority is a case decided in King's Bench in 1697 which
says, "And it was resolved by whole court that though, if goods
be taken from an enemy it vests the property in the party taking
them, by our (common) law, yet by admiralty law, the property of
a ship taken without letters of mart vests in the king upon the
taking, and this on the high seas."<a name="FNanchor_2_91" id="FNanchor_2_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_91" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The same view is expressed
by a modern writer, who says, "The root of the prize system is
found in the ancient doctrine that any person might seize to his
own use, goods belonging to an alien enemy and this right extended
to captures at sea."<a name="FNanchor_3_92" id="FNanchor_3_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_92" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>A case in the reign of Edward III, 1343, bears out
these opinions. The king of Aragon complained of a case of piracy
by Englishmen and asked redress. Edward called his Chancellor
and council and the decision was given that the alleged piracy
was a case of lawful prize and that by the law maritime the goods
belonged to the captor.<a name="FNanchor_4_93" id="FNanchor_4_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_93" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>However, England very early recognized the contrary
principle that prize of war of right belongs to the state and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>private individuals only acquire their title by grant of the
crown or parliament. Thus by a patent of 1242, Henry III granted
half of all prizes taken by them to masters and crews of king's
ships and the same to the men of Oleron and Bayonne in their own
ships.<a name="FNanchor_5_94" id="FNanchor_5_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_94" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In 1295 a letter patent provided that the whole of
prizes taken by Bayonne ships should be shared equally between
the owners and men<a name="FNanchor_6_95" id="FNanchor_6_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_95" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and in the Scotch expedition of 1319
Edward II also granted the whole of prizes to the captors.<a name="FNanchor_7_96" id="FNanchor_7_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_96" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>A close Roll of 1325 states that men of the Cinque
Ports had granted one fourth of all prizes to the king.<a name="FNanchor_8_97" id="FNanchor_8_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_97" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The
Portsmen by a grant of William the Conqueror<a name="FNanchor_9_98" id="FNanchor_9_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_98" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> enjoyed special
privileges in prize matters and claimed to enjoy prizes of their
own right. In early times their forces comprised the greater
part of England's naval strength so this privilege was quite
important. However, the kings seem to have wished to regain some
of the jurisdiction which they had granted away and in the case
mentioned Edward II tried to gain jurisdiction over the whole of the
prize. In 1326 the king's primal right seemed to be recognized as
superior to that of the Portsmen for a grant of that date is made
by the king, of all prizes to the portsmen.<a name="FNanchor_10_99" id="FNanchor_10_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_99" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>


<h4>b. Administration.</h4>

<p>During this period no machinery for adjudication was
established. The only means through which the king could collect
a share of prize was through the common law courts and they proved
in most cases inadequate. The jealously guarded jurisdictions
of the Cinque ports also largely interfered with the king's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>perquisites in prize. Their peculiar customs were held above the
king's right. Thus in 1293 when Edward I claimed a share of
prizes captured by Portsmen they stated that on the occasion in
question they had hoisted a flag called the "Baucon". This action
meant a fight to the death in which case by the universally
recognized law of the sea all prizes captured by the survivors
belonged to them. Furthermore if the king endeavored to interfere
with them they would leave the country.<a name="FNanchor_11_100" id="FNanchor_11_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_100" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Such assertions of
independence probably prevented much state interference with
prize distribution at this period.</p>

<h4>a. Laws.</h4>

<p>After the battle of Sluys in 1340 when Edward III
became in fact master of the seas, a title which kings of England
had assumed since the time of John, the king issued certain
ordinances for the distribution of prize.<a name="FNanchor_1_101" id="FNanchor_1_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_101" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> A distinction was
made between prizes taken by ships in the king's pay and privateers.
At that time there was no navy owned by the state. In the former
case the king is to receive one fourth of the proceeds of all
prizes, the owner of the vessel one fourth and the remainder
"shall belong to those who took them which halfe ought to be shared
equally between them". Out of the portion going to the captors
the admiral has two shares or as much as two mariners from each
ship, if he is present when the capture is made, if absent he
only receives one share. It is also provided that "ships out
of sight shall receive no share unless sailing toward and in
sight so as to help the takers if need be." The apparent purport
of this anomalous language being that joint captors must be of
actual constructive assistance to share. In the case of privateers
the king has no share of prizes. The whole amount goes to the
captors except the admirals perquisite which is the same as in
the former case. It is further provided that "whoever takes a
ship ought to bring it before the admiral, there to take and
receive what the law and custom of the sea requires", no plunder
of the prize being permitted before adjudication except on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>decks.<a name="FNanchor_2_102" id="FNanchor_2_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_102" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>By a patent of 1386 the king gives all his share to
the admiral<a name="FNanchor_3_103" id="FNanchor_3_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_103" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the following year the whole of prizes is
granted to privateers.<a name="FNanchor_4_104" id="FNanchor_4_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_104" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In 1406 a grant of Henry IV provides that ship
owners shall have prizes taken from the enemy but they must
deliver up to the king any prisoners they may take for whom a
reasonable reward will be given.<a name="FNanchor_5_105" id="FNanchor_5_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_105" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In the same year a letter
from the admiral calls on all mariners to enter the king's service
and says that "whatever profits and gains such persons shall make
from the king's enemies on said voyages they shall have and
enjoy freely without impediment or disturbance."<a name="FNanchor_6_106" id="FNanchor_6_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_106" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> By statute of
1416<a name="FNanchor_7_107" id="FNanchor_7_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_107" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> it was provided that letters of Marque might be issued by
the privy council to any one having grievances against a foreign
power. In such issues of letters of Marque the profit of goods
taken went to the captor to the extent of the damages received.
All goods in excess of that amount were supposed to be returned
but few cases of such return are on record.<a name="FNanchor_8_108" id="FNanchor_8_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_108" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It was under
authority of this act that letters of Marque were issued in
England until the final abolition of the practice in the treaty
of Paris of 1856.</p>

<p>A treaty with Flanders of 1426 contains the
provision that "no prizes shall be divided at sea or in a foreign
harbour but shall be brought entire to a port of England and there
it will be adjudged by the king and council, the chancellor or
the admiral whether the prize belonged to friends or enemies and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>it will be disposed of in good and brief manner."<a name="FNanchor_9_109" id="FNanchor_9_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_109" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Here we seem
to have a distinct enunciation of the most modern principles of
prize law that no title to prize is legally conferred until
after adjudication by a competent organ of the state making the
capture.</p>

<p>In 1442 an ordinance of Henry VI "for the safeguarding
of the sea" emphasizes these same principles. It
declares that neutrals must not be harmed in war and that award
of prize must be made by a competent tribunal before distribution
of proceeds. The scheme to be used in distributing the proceeds
in case the vessel is found good prize is as follows: One half
goes to the master, quarter master, sailors and soldiers. The
remainder is to be divided into three parts, of which two go to
the owners and one to the chief and under captains. The
ordinance also contains rules for the conduct of privateers.<a name="FNanchor_10_110" id="FNanchor_10_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_110" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
In the same year a statute<a name="FNanchor_11_111" id="FNanchor_11_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_111" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> permitted any one making capture
of an enemy vessel "to take the goods and merchandises and
enjoy them without any restitution thereof to be made in any wise,
even though the goods belonged to neutrals and they had no safe
conduct from the king of England."</p>

<p>Shortly before this, the collection of sea laws
known as the Black book of the Admiralty was compiled for the
use of the Lord High Admiral. The book contains that ancient
body of sea law, the Roles of Oleron,<a name="FNanchor_12_112" id="FNanchor_12_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_112" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> besides several later
ordinances and inquests. The principle portion dealing with prize
distribution is part "A" which consists of the ordinance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Edward III made after the battle of Sluys, already mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_13_113" id="FNanchor_13_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_113" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
It also contains "An inquisition made at Queensborough in 1375"
which is a statement by a jury of the existing law at that time.
It restates the earlier ordinance of Edward III except that the
king's share of prizes is not mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_14_114" id="FNanchor_14_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_114" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The inquest also
permits merchant ships to make captures from the king's enemies,
apparently without a special commission and divide the proceeds
two thirds to the owner and one third to the mariners.<a name="FNanchor_15_115" id="FNanchor_15_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_115" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Captures
by merchant vessels without commission seem to have been quite
common and were openly approved by the king.<a name="FNanchor_16_116" id="FNanchor_16_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_116" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The fact that
these ancient ordinances were collected for authoritative use
seems to indicate that they were recognized law in the fifteenth
century.</p>


<h4>b. Administration.</h4>

<p>The period of the hundred years war, thus brought
about definite progress in prize money laws. Prize distribution
became the subject of definite ordinances. In Edward Third's
ordinance most of the principles of prize distribution mentioned
by international law writers of three centuries later were
enunciated.<a name="FNanchor_17_117" id="FNanchor_17_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_117" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The issuance of such an ordinance implied a
recognition of the principle, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bello parta cedunt reipublicae</span>"<a name="FNanchor_18_118" id="FNanchor_18_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_118" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
the original title to prize vests in the state. Definite rules
for distribution were declared and most important of all,
adjudication of prizes by a competent court was demanded before
distribution. The office of admiral was created by Edward I in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>the year 1300 when Gervase Alvard was appointed Admiral of the
Cinque Ports. At first several admirals were appointed with
jurisdiction over different portions of the sea. In 1340 owing
to difficulties which he got into with neutral powers, who
complained of the depredations of English privateers, the court
of admiralty was created with prize jurisdiction in such cases.
The first mention of prize courts is in 1357.<a name="FNanchor_19_119" id="FNanchor_19_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_119" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Attempts were
made by the common law courts to retain their jurisdiction but
it soon became recognized that sea matters were properly under
the control of the admiralty. In 1360 one admiral was appointed
for all the fleets in the person of Sir John Beauchamp. The duties
of the office were greatly extended, in fact it claimed so wide
a jurisdiction that in the reign of Richard II two statutes<a name="FNanchor_20_120" id="FNanchor_20_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_120" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
were passed greatly limiting the Admiral's power.</p>

<p>The office of admiral was of a two-fold character.
He was not only commander-in-chief of the navy and as such
entitled to share in prizes, but also he exercised the king's
power of jurisdiction over the sea and in this capacity presided
over the courts of admiralty and the prize courts. In the latter
capacity the connection of the admiral with the privy council was
very close. He was himself a member of the privy council and
that body always exercised final jurisdiction in prize cases if it
saw fit. It should be understood that no normal adjudication
of all prizes was at this time required. In the Black Book of the
Admiralty the admiral was given vigorous means of collecting his
perquisites, "inquiry is to be made of all ships, who have not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>paid the admiral his share, the names of the captors, masters,
owners and value of goods taken is to be presented."<a name="FNanchor_21_121" id="FNanchor_21_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_121" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Thus it
was only in special cases where the admiral had heard of a
capture and had not received a share or where some party made a
complaint, that a case was adjudicated. The great majority of
cases never came before the court and the captor had undisturbed
possession.</p>

<p>The apparent insufficiency of the admiralty in
prize cases brought forth a new set of officers in 1414, the
Conservators of the Ports.<a name="FNanchor_22_122" id="FNanchor_22_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_122" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> These officers had criminal and
prize jurisdiction in maritime cases but the plan seems to have
been attended with small success and soon fell into desuetude.</p>

<p>Through this period the Cinque Ports maintained to
some extent their ancient privileges. The Warden of the Ports
exercised the function of admiral over mariners sailing from
them. Nominally he was under the authority of the Lord High
Admiral but as a matter of fact he exercised an almost independent
jurisdiction until 1628.</p>

<p>As noted the issue of letters of Marque by the
privy council was authorized by statute but the carriage of such
letters by privateers does not seem to have been universally
required, especially in war. Efforts were made to restrain
privateering by law for the benefit of neutrals.</p>


<h4>c. Significance.</h4>

<p>What accounts for England's very early adoption in
theory at least of these advanced principles of maritime law?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>England's insular position turned her people to the sea and
commerce. The French wars necessitated a continuous military
and naval policy. It also brought about internal unity and
nationalism much earlier than in other countries. Thus the state
definitely organized and regulated the navy. The great naval
victories and the assumption by the king of the title "master of
the seas" increased the spirit of nationalism and naval pride.
There was however, a conflict between "the rights of the king
as sovereign lord of the sea entitled to demand for offence
and defence the service of all his subjects; the privileged
corporations of the sea port towns with their peculiar customs
and great local independence; and the private adventure of
independent merchants and mariners whose proceedings seem to be
scarcely one degree removed from piracy."<a name="FNanchor_23_123" id="FNanchor_23_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_123" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> But as we have noted
the king emerged from the conflict victorious. The office of
Lord High Admiral of all the seas was created, the navy came to
be considered a definite branch of the royal administration.
A royal navy was built up under Henry IV and Henry V. The king
affirmed his right to prize and his right of jurisdiction over
privateers and their captures.</p>

<p>But along with England's aggressive naval policy
was her dependence upon commerce. Successful commerce necessitated
strict recognition of neutral rights and a rule of order at sea,
embracing the destruction of piracy and illegal privateering.
Thus the king established the admiralty as a prize court, made
treaties binding himself to the protection of neutral rights,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>demanded adjudication of all prizes, and sought by ordinance to
restrain illegal privateering. After the reign of Henry V the
commercial interests of England won the upper hand, the royal
navy was sold, the naval protection was placed in the hands of
commissioned merchant privateers and more strict enforcement
of neutral rights was sought. Thus the conflict between an
aggressive naval policy and the protection and encouragement of
commerce brought about a very early recognition in England of
advanced principles of prize capture and distribution.</p>

<p>Through the latter half of the fifteenth century,
England was too distraught by internal struggles to pay much
attention to naval matters and no progress was made in prize money
laws.</p>

<p>It is impossible to tell specifically the effects
of the prize money laws in England at this early date. However,
in so far as they formed an important element in the general
maritime laws, they undoubtedly tended to create order at sea,
to protect commerce and to increase the king's jurisdiction over
the sea forces. This coordination of authority over sea war
would tend to increase naval efficiency and was an important
element in making England a great sea power.</p>

<h4>a. Laws.</h4>

<p>After the wars of the roses prize distribution was
still occasionally decreed by special letters patent. In his
famous voyage of 1496 John Cabot was by letter patent required
to give one fifth of all prizes to the king.<a name="FNanchor_1_124" id="FNanchor_1_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_124" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In 1512 the
admiral guaranteed to turn over to the king one half of "all
manner of gaynes and wynnyngs of werre".<a name="FNanchor_2_125" id="FNanchor_2_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_125" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This rule was repeated
in 1521.<a name="FNanchor_3_126" id="FNanchor_3_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_126" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Frequently the charters of vessels authorized them
to take prizes. The charter party of the ship "Cheritie" dated
1531 says: "and yff the sayd shyppe take any pryse, purchase
any flotson or lagen, hit shalbe devyded into III equal parties,
that ys to the sayd capmerchaunte the one parte and to the owner
the second parte and to the master and his companye the therde
parte."<a name="FNanchor_4_127" id="FNanchor_4_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_127" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Similarly the charter party of the "George", 1535,
provided that: "If any prize, purches, flotezon, or lagason or
any other casueltie happe to be taken by the saide ships in this
her present viage the saide merchaunt shall have his juste parte
thereof accordyng to the lawe of Oleron."<a name="FNanchor_5_128" id="FNanchor_5_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_128" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In the rule of 1544
mariners carrying letters of marque were granted the whole of
their prizes without accounting to the admiral or warden of the
ports for any.<a name="FNanchor_6_129" id="FNanchor_6_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_129" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> A similar proclamation was issued by Mary in her
French wars of 1557.<a name="FNanchor_7_130" id="FNanchor_7_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_130" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> With few exceptions however the admiral
had a right to one tenth of all prizes.</p>

<p>Elizabeth increased this share to one third in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>case of captures made by the queen's ships but it remained one tenth
in the case of privateers. In 1585<a name="FNanchor_8_131" id="FNanchor_8_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_131" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Elizabeth issued a proclamation
authorizing the Lord High Admiral to issue letters of reprisal
to all who showed that they had suffered losses from Spain. Rules
for distribution of proceeds and for the conduct of privateers
were included. Similar proclamations have been issued by the
sovereign of England at the beginning of every subsequent war in
which privateering was allowed. The proclamation provided for
the division of the proceeds, one third to the owners, one third
to the victualer, and one third to the officers and crew. The
captain also was entitled to the best piece of ordnance and the
master the best anchor and cable. Officers and crew were
especially granted the right of pillage on the decks.<a name="FNanchor_9_132" id="FNanchor_9_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_132" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In 1589
Elizabeth was in alliance with Henry IV of France. A remarkable
proclamation of this time authorized English subjects to take
letters of marque from the French king and provided that he
should be entitled to one fifth of the proceeds of all prizes.<a name="FNanchor_10_133" id="FNanchor_10_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_133" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>


<h4>b. Administration.</h4>

<p>Thus during the Tudor period new developments of
prize money law were found. During the period and especially
the latter part of it, England's policy was one of extreme naval
aggressiveness. But instead of being restrained by the commercial
necessities of the previous epoch it was increased by the
renaissance spirit of adventure. England's national unity was
established, the enthusiasm of discovery, the experience of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>immemorial acquaintance with the sea impelled her people into an
unparalleled career of sea conquest. Thus during the Elizabethan
period it is not surprising to find a retrogression in prize law.
Belligerent rights were enforced at the expense of neutrals.
Naval warfare was almost exclusively in the hands of privateers.
The admiral still retained his right to a tenth of prizes, the
queen received a varying share, but the greater part went to
the privateers and at no time was there a definite rule of
distribution. While she publicly disavowed illegal depredations
by her privateers Elizabeth secretly encouraged them.</p>

<p>The actual control of the crown over prize matters
does not seem to have been lost. Illegal depredation of
privateers was not due to inability of the administration to
control them but to the definite policy of the crown. The
high court of admiralty was revived in 1524 after a period of
dormancy during the civil wars and its definite records date
from that time. It exercised a constant prize jurisdiction.
In 1558 the case of Gonner vs. Pattyson<a name="FNanchor_11_134" id="FNanchor_11_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_134" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> came before it. Gonner
obtained a decree granting him a vessel on the plea that "he by
right of war captured as lawful prize the said ship&mdash;belonging
to Scotchmen, foes and enemies of this famous realm of England&mdash;and
that the captors were and are by reason of the premises true
owners and proprietors thereof." In Matthews vs. Goyte,<a name="FNanchor_12_135" id="FNanchor_12_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_135" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> 1565,
the sentence decreed division between joint captors. In 1577
a definite effort was made to suppress piracy. A commission was
appointed to judge and summarily punish pirates with rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>effective results.</p>

<p>Regular adjudication of prize cases was not yet
the rule. Cases were only tried on complaint of one of the
parties but in 1589 an order in council directed that all prizes
be brought in for adjudication by the admiralty.<a name="FNanchor_13_136" id="FNanchor_13_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_136" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The privy
council itself however exercised jurisdiction in many cases.
Thus in 1589 John Gilbert and Walter Raleigh were given a commission
to capture prizes on a certain voyage and divide them among the
crew. Apparently they appropriated the prizes themselves. A
complaint was made to the queen. The matter was considered in
the privy council with the result that Raleigh and Gilbert were
commanded to appear and tell how the money had been disposed of
and especially to answer for the part due the queen.<a name="FNanchor_14_137" id="FNanchor_14_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_137" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> And
again: On the return of the fleet with prizes after the
destruction of the Spanish armada, in 1589, the privy council gave
orders directing the handling of the prizes. Instructions were
given to Sir Anthony Ashley to investigate the prizes and
determine the country of the ship, the amount and value of the
cargo, etc. In the same year on hearing that certain prizes
had been sold and distributed by the captain the queen was very
angry and "tooke yt in very ill parte that anie persons would
adventure to receive or buy anie of those goodes before
aucthorytie or direction was given for the sake of the same."<a name="FNanchor_15_138" id="FNanchor_15_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_138" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In the latter part of Elizabeth's reign vigorous
efforts were made to restrain privateers. In 1601 a new commission
was appointed to hear and arbitrate neutral claims. In 1602
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>by proclamation judges of the admiralty were directed to
institute proceedings against any privateer sailing without
commission or selling prizes before adjudication.<a name="FNanchor_16_139" id="FNanchor_16_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_139" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In this
year the ship "Fortune" was confiscated to the admiralty for
failing to bring in a prize for adjudication.<a name="FNanchor_17_140" id="FNanchor_17_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_140" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> This stand is
most advanced and shows that progress was being made toward a
definite requirement of legal process before prizes could be
distributed. A case of similar nature had occurred in 1598.
The vessel "Grace of Padstow" without a letter of reprisal
captured a Danish prize. The prize was returned by the court
on the grounds that the captor had no commission.<a name="FNanchor_18_141" id="FNanchor_18_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_141" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> This
extreme enforcement of the obligation of privateers to carry
specific commissions has been advocated by some international
law writers.<a name="FNanchor_19_142" id="FNanchor_19_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_142" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> However in cases of actual war, prizes have
never been returned but as in this instance in cases of private
reprisal the return of captures was occasionally enforced.</p>

<p>Thus while in the greater part of the Tudor period
the laws of prize distribution were not so clearly defined as
formerly and great freedom was allowed adventurers and privateers,
at the same time the actual control of distribution by the
administration seems to have been more strict than ever before.
Especially was this true of the latter part of the reign of
Elizabeth.</p>


<h4>c. Significance.</h4>

<p>The effect of the generous laws of distribution
of this period undoubtedly was to encourage adventure and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>privateering. The voyages of the great sea captains of Elizabeth
were fitted out primarily for the sake of private gain from
prizes. Preying on Spanish Galleons not only satisfied the love of
adventure of such men as Hawkins, Drake and Raleigh but it also
gave them wealth. So long as their acts harmonized with the
queen's policy she did not care to inquire too closely into the
strict legality of all their seizures. This policy by which the
queen not only made the navy support itself but actually received
income from it through her share of prizes enabled Elizabeth to
carry on her wars without any national expense. Her reign is
renowned for its economy and lack of taxation. This doubtless
added to its popularity and increased the sense of nationalism
in the English nation. During this period generous giving of
prize money was a valuable means of increasing the efficiency
of the navy and the national unity of England. The strict acts
of the latter part of Elizabeth's reign and their consistent
enforcement indicated genuine progress in the protection of
neutral rights at sea through governmental control.</p>

<h4>a. Laws.</h4>

<p>Instructions to privateers similar to Elizabeth's
proclamation of 1585 were issued in 1625.<a name="FNanchor_1_143" id="FNanchor_1_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_143" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In instructions of
1628<a name="FNanchor_2_144" id="FNanchor_2_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_144" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the king's tenth of prizes is referred to. During the
civil war the two contending parties each issued proclamations
authorizing letters of marque. In 1643 an ordinance of parliament
provided that captures made by privateers after adjudication in
the admiralty court and payment of tenths and customs should
belong to the captors.<a name="FNanchor_3_145" id="FNanchor_3_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_145" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Similar acts were passed in 1644 and
1645.<a name="FNanchor_4_146" id="FNanchor_4_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_146" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> More extensive provisions were made in an act of 1648.<a name="FNanchor_5_147" id="FNanchor_5_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_147" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Prize bounty of ten pounds per gun for every enemy vessel
destroyed was for the first time granted in an act of this same
year.<a name="FNanchor_6_148" id="FNanchor_6_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_148" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> An elaborate parliamentary enactment of 1649 provided
for division of prize between the captors, the state, the sick,
wounded and the relatives of the slain. A man of war captured
by a state ship was divided, one half to the officers and crew,
and one half to the sick and wounded. If the enemy vessel was
destroyed a gun money or bounty of ten to twenty pounds for
each gun on the destroyed ship was distributed in the same manner.
If the vessel captured was a merchant ship, one third went to
the captors, one third to the state and one third to the sick and
wounded. In the case of a privateer making the capture, one third
went to the officers and crew, one third to the sick and wounded,
one sixth to the owner and one sixth to the state. Recaptures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>were to be returned to the original owner on the payment of one
eighth salvage. The customary Admiral's one-tenth was to be paid
into the state treasury and used for the purchase of medals.<a name="FNanchor_7_149" id="FNanchor_7_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_149" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Piracy was extremely prevalent at that time.
Adherents of Prince Rupert plundered British vessels without
scruple. A successful effort to stop such depredations was
made in 1650. The authorizing act provided for division of the
captured pirate vessels at the rate of one half to the state,
one third to the owner and one sixth to the officers and crew.<a name="FNanchor_8_150" id="FNanchor_8_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_150" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
In a declaration of 1652 the admiralty forbade the old custom
of pillage on deck, demanding that the prize be brought in to
port intact,<a name="FNanchor_9_151" id="FNanchor_9_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_151" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but the order seems to have proved impossible of
execution and after the Restoration the old custom was revived.</p>

<p>An ordinance of 1660 authorized the capture as
prize of vessels breaking the provisions of the navigation act
and provided for the division of such prizes, one half to the
captors and one half to the state.<a name="FNanchor_10_152" id="FNanchor_10_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_152" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The navigation act of
1663<a name="FNanchor_11_153" id="FNanchor_11_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_153" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> provided for the adjudication of such prizes in the
vice admiralty courts of the colonies. The division of the proceeds
was to be one-third to the colonial governor, one-third to the
king and one-third to the captors.</p>

<p>Shortly after the restoration of Charles II in 1661
an act was passed by parliament for the regulation of the navy.<a name="FNanchor_12_154" id="FNanchor_12_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_154" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Among other things it forbids spoil of prizes before adjudication
but especially permits pillage on the decks. In 1749 this act
was amended and the ancient practice of giving up the decks to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>plunder was finally forbidden.<a name="FNanchor_13_155" id="FNanchor_13_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_155" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In ordinances issued before the Dutch war of
1664<a name="FNanchor_14_156" id="FNanchor_14_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_156" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and the French war of 1666<a name="FNanchor_15_157" id="FNanchor_15_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_157" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> all prizes were granted to the
captors with the sole reservation of the admiral's tenth. Prizes
were also liable to payment of customs duties. An order in
council of the latter date defined the rights of the king and
admiral in prizes "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona inimicorum</span>"<a name="FNanchor_16_158" id="FNanchor_16_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_158" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. To the king by Jure Coronae
belonged all prizes driven into harbor by the king's ships,
seized in port before war broke out coming into port voluntarily
or deserting from the enemy. To the Lord High Admiral by Droits
of admiralty belonged ships captured at sea by non-commissioned
captors, salvage due for ships recaptured from the enemy, and
ships forsaken by the crew unless in the presence of the king's
ships. In other cases the rule of the ordinance held good, the
admiral received only his tenth and the king his customs duties
the remainder going to the captors.</p>


<h4>b. Administration.</h4>

<p>From this brief resumé of the legislation of the
seventeenth century it is evident that the laws, reached, during
this period, a certain definiteness and stability which they had
before lacked. In 1628 the office of Lord High Admiral was
temporarily put in commission and given a more systematic
organization. From this time the prize cases of the court are
recorded on separate records and condemnation before distribution
of prizes was the rule. Sir Leoline Jenkins says "And the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>Admiral may inquire if any defraud the king of his prizes, or
the admiral of his one tenth part or buy or receive prize goods
or break bulk before they are condemned as prize or there be a
decree for an appraisement or sale."<a name="FNanchor_17_159" id="FNanchor_17_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_159" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The prestige of the admiralty was increased through
the fact that the Warden of the Cinque Ports, Zouche, sold out
his right to Lord High Admiral Buckingham in 1624.<a name="FNanchor_18_160" id="FNanchor_18_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_160" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> From this
time the Courts of admiralty were virtually supreme in maritime
jurisdiction. Thus Jenkins said, "The Admiralty has jurisdiction
over offences, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">super altum mare</span>, punishable by laws of Oleron,
laws of admiralty, or laws or statutes of the realm."<a name="FNanchor_19_161" id="FNanchor_19_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_161" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The
Cinque ports still retained jurisdiction over certain matters.
During the latter part of the seventeenth century through the
adverse pressure of the crown on the side of its prize
jurisdiction and of the common law courts on the side of its
instance jurisdiction the authority and prestige of the admiralty
court greatly declined.</p>

<p>The civil wars of the middle Stuart period precluded
a possibility of prize-law development, rather it encouraged
piracy and maintained disorder. Parliamentarians and royalists
authorized unrestrained privateering against the opposition.
During the Stuart exile, Prince Rupert was at the head of an
organized system of piracy. The Puritan regime and the
restoration period however witnessed a marked advance in the
legalizing of maritime methods. The Puritans stood for law and
popular control. They did much to crush piracy, required the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53a" id="Page_53a">[53a]</a></span>carriage of letters of marque by privateers and the first act
of parliament touching prize distribution appeared at this time.
It is to be noted however that while the government claimed
prior rights in prizes and demanded legal adjudication; in
behalf of a forward naval policy it displayed exceptional
generosity to the captors, in its rule of division of proceeds.
Not only did all the prize go to the captors but in addition
bounty was granted in case of the destruction or capture of
armed vessels and medals were awarded for specially meritorious
acts. The extreme effort of the Puritans to enforce legality
at sea is evidenced by the effort to abolish the old custom
of pillage on deck and the great number of prize cases settled
in the court of admiralty at this period. During this time
Zouche of Oxford published his great work on international law
and did much to crystallize legal views on prize matters.<a name="FNanchor_20_162" id="FNanchor_20_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_162" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The restoration period carried out the same
principles in general except that with the restoration of the
office of Lord High Admiral the old Droits d'Admiralty were
revived. In these periods the humane policy of apportioning a
share of the prizes to the sick, wounded and heirs of the slain
was instituted, a policy continued in the later practice of
maintaining a naval hospital at Greenwich with the proceeds of
forfeited shares of prize money.<a name="FNanchor_21_163" id="FNanchor_21_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_163" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In 1690 the whole privy
council was constituted a court of appeal in prize cases.<a name="FNanchor_22_164" id="FNanchor_22_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_164" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
Vice Admiralty courts with prize jurisdiction had been established
in the colonies.<a name="FNanchor_23_165" id="FNanchor_23_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_165" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The colonial governor was usually the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>Vice Admiral of the colony. The great trading companies were
usually granted large rights of reprisal but adjudication was
required in the court of admiralty. In 1690 the king received
the admiral's share of one tenth in a case involving a prize of
100,000 pounds captured by the East India Company from the
great Mogul.<a name="FNanchor_24_166" id="FNanchor_24_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_166" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The legislation of the seventeenth century gave
complete recognition to the Grotian principles of prize
distribution and in practice these laws seem to have been applied
regularly and consistently by well established legal institutions.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER IV. GREAT BRITAIN, RECENT LAWS.</a></h2>

<h3><a name="Part41" id="Part41"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART 1. 1688-1864.</a></h3>


<p>After the revolution of 1688 English methods of
legislation became in many cases crystallized into their present
form. This was true of prize money law. In 1692<a name="FNanchor_1_167" id="FNanchor_1_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_167" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the first
statute granting prize money to the captors was passed, for the
purpose as the bill stated of encouraging privateers in the
pending war with France.</p>

<p>In connection with instructions for privateers
issued in 1693<a name="FNanchor_2_168" id="FNanchor_2_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_168" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> provision was made that prize ships taken by
privateers should go to the captors but the king was entitled
to one-fifth of the goods on board, the other four-fifths going
to the captors. Prizes taken by king's or hired ships went,
one-third to the widows and children of the slain, the sick and
the wounded; one-third to the officers and crew; and one-third
to the king. Gun money of five pounds a gun was granted for
capturing or destroying a man of war in addition to the prize
money. Recaptured ships were to be returned after payment of
salvage of one-third to one-eighth according to the time the
vessel had been in the enemy's possession.</p>

<p>With the outbreak of the war of the Spanish
succession the statutory method of providing for prize distribution
was established. By a statute of 1707<a name="FNanchor_3_169" id="FNanchor_3_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_169" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the sole property in all
prizes was granted to the officers and seamen of queen's ships
and the officers, seamen and owners of privateers, the capture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>being first adjudged good prize in a court of admiralty. The
act also provided for the payment of head money or bounty to the
amount of five pounds per man on board every war ship or
privateer of the enemy, sunk or destroyed. The act was to
continue only for that war. Orders in council issued on
authority of the act provided details for the conduct of prize
courts and the division of prize money and bounty among the captors.
In reference to this act and the previous history of prize money
in England, Lord Loughborough said in 1789,<a name="FNanchor_4_170" id="FNanchor_4_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_170" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> "Before the sixth
year of the reign of Queen Anne there were no laws made on the
subject. Previous to that time all prizes taken in war were of
right vested in the crown and questions concerning the property
of such prizes were not the subject of discussion in courts
of law. But in order to do justice to claimants from the first
year after the restoration of Charles II, special commissions
were issued to enable courts of Admiralty to condemn such
captures as appeared to be lawful prizes,<a name="FNanchor_5_171" id="FNanchor_5_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_171" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to give relief where
there was no color for the taking and generally to make
satisfaction to parties injured. But in the sixth year of
Queen Anne it was thought proper for the encouragement of
seamen to vest in them the prizes they should take and for that
purpose the statutes of 6 Anne c 13 and c 37 were passed."
From the foregoing discussion it appears that the learned judge
failed to note the statute 4-5 Wm. and Mary c 25 passed in 1692
not to mention the commonwealth statutes of 1648 and 1649.
It also seems clear that admiralty courts exercised jurisdiction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>over prize matters long before the restoration of Charles II.</p>

<p>Queen Anne's act of 1707 is typical of those
which have been passed at the beginning of every subsequent
war in English history until the passage of the permanent prize
act of 1864.<a name="FNanchor_6_172" id="FNanchor_6_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_172" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Since that time the principle of giving the total
proceeds of prize to the captors has been adhered to although
the principle that the initial title to all captures vests in
the crown has been maintained with equal consistency.</p>

<p>Another act of 1707<a name="FNanchor_7_173" id="FNanchor_7_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_173" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> extended the act previously
mentioned to captures made in America and provided for prize
jurisdiction in colonial courts of vice admiralty. The outbreak
of the war of the Austrian succession brought forth the prize
act of 1740.<a name="FNanchor_8_174" id="FNanchor_8_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_174" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This added to Queen Anne's act the provision
that vessels recaptured should be restored to the original
owners on the payment of one eighth salvage. A new act was
passed in 1744<a name="FNanchor_9_175" id="FNanchor_9_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_175" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which repeated the former acts adding provisions
in regard to privateers. It was provided that captures by
privateers should belong to the ship exclusively and division
between the owners and crew should be regulated by special contract
between them. The admiralty was authorized to issue letters of
Marque on receiving of satisfactory bond of good behaviour
from the owners.</p>

<p>The act of 1756<a name="FNanchor_10_176" id="FNanchor_10_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_176" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> repeated the provisions of the
preceding act with reference to the Seven Years war, as did
the act of 1776<a name="FNanchor_11_177" id="FNanchor_11_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_177" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> with reference to the American Revolution and
the acts of 1779,<a name="FNanchor_12_178" id="FNanchor_12_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_178" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> 1780,<a name="FNanchor_13_179" id="FNanchor_13_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_179" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and 1781<a name="FNanchor_14_180" id="FNanchor_14_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_180" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> passed on the outbreak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>of hostilities with France, Spain and Holland, respectively.
In the act passed in 1793<a name="FNanchor_15_181" id="FNanchor_15_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_181" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> to regulate prize matters in the
French war a few new provisions were added. Captures on land
were put under the jurisdiction of the admiralty and similar
principles of division authorized. Joint captures by land and
naval forces were to be divided by special orders in council.
Recaptures were to be returned on paying a salvage of one-eighth
in case the capture was made by a public vessel, and one-sixth
if made by a privateer. The duration of this act was extended
by an act of 1797.<a name="FNanchor_16_182" id="FNanchor_16_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_182" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> At the outbreak of war with America a
prize proclamation was issued, Oct. 26, 1812.<a name="FNanchor_17_183" id="FNanchor_17_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_183" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It provided
"That the net produce of all prizes taken, the right whereof
is inherent in His Majesty and his crown be given to the takers".
Rules were then given for the division among the officers and
crew. An act of 1813<a name="FNanchor_18_184" id="FNanchor_18_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_184" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> authorized this proclamation and an act
of the following year<a name="FNanchor_19_185" id="FNanchor_19_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_185" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> gave complete rules for prize distribution.
Aside from the matters covered in previous acts it provided that
all prize money shares not claimed or forfeited should go to the
support of the Greenwich naval hospital. An elaborate scheme
for the division of shares was included. By this scheme the
proceeds of prizes taken before 1808 were to be divided into five
shares, besides the flag shares, which were to be divided among
five grades of seamen. Those taken after 1808 were to be
divided into eight shares and in the same manner distributed
among eight grades of seamen. The sizes of vessels were evidently
increasing rapidly, to necessitate this change in the number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>of grades of mariners.</p>

<p>In 1815 a very elaborate act<a name="FNanchor_20_186" id="FNanchor_20_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_186" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> was called forth
by the return of Napoleon from Elba, entitled "an act for the
encouragement of seamen and the more effectual manning of his
majesty's navy during the present war." It provided that the
flag officers, commanders and crew should have sole right in all
prizes taken by public armed vessels declared lawful prize before
courts of admiralty or vice admiralty to be divided in proportions
from time to time decreed by orders in council. Hired armed
vessels were subject to the same rules. Captures made with
aid of allies were to be divided equally with the ally. Land
captures made by the navy were also the sole property of the
captors after proper adjudication, but joint captures by land and
naval forces were to be subject to special order in council.
Desertion, forfeited shared of prize money. Recaptures were
to be returned to the original owner on the payment of one-eighth
salvage if the captor was a public vessel and one-sixth if a
private vessel, except that if the recaptured vessel had been
fitted out by the enemy as a war ship it should not be returned
to the original owner but should be declared good prize for the
benefit of the captors. Head money or bounty of five pounds
per man on board every enemy ship at the beginning of an
engagement was to be paid all vessels capturing, sinking or
destroying a war ship or privateer of the enemy. Ransom of
captured vessels was forbidden except in case of necessity.
All money given as bounty or salvage was to be subject to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>same rules of division as prize money. Letters of Marque were
to be granted on proper security for good behavior and the
privateers were to be sole proprietors of all captures after
proper adjudication. The force of this act only extended to the
pending war.</p>

<p>During the middle of the nineteenth century
England was engaged in an active campaign to suppress the slave
trade. As a result proclamations were constantly issued decreeing
the division of the proceeds of vessels captured in this trade.
The same rules were followed as in the case of prizes of war,
the whole of the captures being given to the captor after
adjudication. Such proclamations were issued in 1834,<a name="FNanchor_21_187" id="FNanchor_21_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_187" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> 1846,<a name="FNanchor_22_188" id="FNanchor_22_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_188" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
1849<a name="FNanchor_23_189" id="FNanchor_23_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_189" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and were authorized by a statute passed in 1839<a name="FNanchor_24_190" id="FNanchor_24_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_190" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and
amended in 1842.<a name="FNanchor_25_191" id="FNanchor_25_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_191" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>In the Crimean war of 1854 England followed her
old policy in prize distribution.<a name="FNanchor_26_192" id="FNanchor_26_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_192" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The act of 1815 was
practically reenacted. In addition it was provided that for
any breach of her majesty's instructions or the law of nations
the shares of prize money would be forfeited to the crown.
In this war Great Britain was in alliance with France and an
interesting treaty was entered into by the two countries providing
for the division of prizes between them.<a name="FNanchor_27_193" id="FNanchor_27_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_193" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Prizes were to be
adjudicated by the courts of the country of the officer in
superior command in the engagement. Joint captors in sight were
to share but adjudication was always to be by the country of
the ship making the actual capture. If vessels of one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>allies were captured for illicit trade it was to be tried by
the country of the captured vessel. In case of vessels of the
two countries acting in conjunction or of vessels of the two
countries giving constructive assistance the net proceeds were
to be divided to the several vessels according to the number
of men on board irrespective of rank. Distribution was to be
regulated by the municipal laws of each country. The treaty
also contained instruction for bringing in prizes. A similar
treaty was entered into by France and Great Britain in their
joint expedition against China in 1860.<a name="FNanchor_28_194" id="FNanchor_28_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_194" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<h3><a name="PART_2_1864-1913" id="PART_2_1864-1913"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART 2. 1864-1913.</a></h3>


<p>Prize distribution in Great Britain at present
is authorized by two permanent acts passed in 1864. The first
of these acts known as the "Naval agency and distribution act
of 1864"<a name="FNanchor_1_195" id="FNanchor_1_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_195" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> provides that all salvage, bounty and prize money
be distributed according to proclamation or order in council and
that the shares in which such distribution shall occur be
determined in the same manner. Pursuant to this act a proclamation
was issued August 3, 1886<a name="FNanchor_2_196" id="FNanchor_2_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_196" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> providing that the whole of prizes
legally adjudicated be for the benefit of officers and seamen
making the capture and that the flag officers receive one-thirtieth
of the proceeds and the captain one-tenth. The remainder is to
be divided equally among eleven grades of officers and seamen.
This rule has been superseded by an Order in Council of
September 17, 1900<a name="FNanchor_3_197" id="FNanchor_3_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_197" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> shortly after the outbreak of the South
African war. It provides that only ships within sight so as to
cause intimidation of the enemy are to share in prize money as
joint captors. All bounty, salvage and prize money received
for any action are to be in general divided in the same manner.
The flag officer is to receive one-thirtieth of the prize but
no share of bounty, unless actually present at the capture.
The captain in actual command receives one-tenth. The remainder
is divided among eleven grades of officers and men as before.</p>

<p>The other act now in force regulating prize matter
is the "Naval Prize Act of 1864".<a name="FNanchor_4_198" id="FNanchor_4_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_198" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It provides for prize courts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>and prescribes their procedure, these matters however have
been amended by "the prize courts act of 1894".<a name="FNanchor_5_199" id="FNanchor_5_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_199" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In joint
captures by land and naval forces prize courts have jurisdiction.
In cases of the infraction of municipal or international law
all proceeds of the prize go to the government, notwithstanding
any grant that may have been made to the captors. Ships taken
as prize by any ship other than a regular ship of war enure
solely to the government. This provision effectually abolishes
privateering. Recaptured ships are to be returned to the
original owner if an English subject on payment of from
one-eighth to one-fourth salvage unless they have been fitted
out by the enemy as ships of war when they will be considered
good prize. If prize bounty is granted in any war by proclamation
the officers and crew actually present at the taking or destroying
of any armed ship of the enemy are entitled to bounty calculated
at the rate of five pounds for each person on board the enemy's
ship at the beginning of the engagement. The saving clause of
the act states that "nothing in this act shall give to the
officers and crew of any of her majesty's ships of war any right
or claim in or to any ship or goods taken as prize or the
proceeds thereof, it being the intent of this act that such
officers and crews shall consent to take only such interest
(if any) in the proceeds of prizes as may be from time to time
granted to them by the crown." The principle that original
title to all prize vests in the crown is thus distinctly asserted.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best exposition of the present rules
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>for the conduct of prizes and the distribution of the proceeds
from them is contained in the instructions to naval officers
which have been authoritatively issued in England, based on
the statutes and orders mentioned. Such a code was prepared by
Mr. Godfrey Lushington in 1866<a name="FNanchor_6_200" id="FNanchor_6_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_200" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and revised by Prof. T. E. Holland
in 1888.<a name="FNanchor_7_201" id="FNanchor_7_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_201" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It contains the following provisions<a name="FNanchor_8_202" id="FNanchor_8_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_202" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> bearing on
bounty, prize salvage and prize money.</p>

<p>"247&mdash;When any ship or vessel shall be captured
or detained her hatches are to be securely fastened and sealed
and her lading and furniture and in general everything on board
are to be carefully secured from embezzlement. The officers
placed in charge of her shall prevent anything from being taken
out of her until she has been tried and sentence shall have been
passed on her in a court of prize.</p>

<p>"250&mdash;If any ship or vessel shall be taken
acting as a ship of war or privateer without having a commission
duly authorizing her to do so, a full report of all particulars
is at once to be made to the admiralty.</p>

<p>"252&mdash;The ship to which a prize strikes her
flag is the actual captor. Other ships may be held by the prize
court to share as joint captors on the ground either of
association or cooperation with the actual captor.</p>

<p>"253&mdash;If ships are associated or cooperating
together a capture made by one enures to the benefit of all.</p>

<p>"255&mdash;Ships being in sight of the prize as also
of the captor under circumstances to cause intimidation to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>prize and encouragement to the captor are held to be cooperating
with the actual captor.</p>

<p>"259&mdash;In the case of captures made jointly by
British and allied ships of war the duties of the respective
commanders are usually regulated by treaty.</p>

<p>"263&mdash;Upon adjudication the prize court will
order the vessel and cargo to be restored to their respective
owners upon payment by them of prize salvage.</p>

<p>"266&mdash;The prize salvage which will be awarded
to the recaptors for the recapture of any British vessel before
she has been carried into an enemy's port is one-eighth part of
the value of the prize or in case the recapture has been made
under circumstances of special difficulty or danger a sum not
exceeding one-fourth part of the value.</p>

<p>"267&mdash;If however the vessel has before her
recapture been set forth or used by the enemy as a ship of war,
then upon recapture the original owner is not entitled to
restitution, but both vessel and cargo will be condemned as
lawful prize to the recaptor.</p>

<p>"269&mdash;It may happen that an enemy vessel which
has been captured by a British cruiser is afterwards lost to an
enemy's cruiser and finally recaptured by another British
cruiser. The commander effecting such a recapture should send
in the vessel for adjudication and the original captors are not
entitled to restitution, but both vessel and cargo would be
condemned as lawful prize to the recaptors.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<p>"270&mdash;If a commander recapture from the enemy
a neutral vessel which would not have been liable to condemnation
in the prize court of the enemy he is not entitled to salvage
and should without delay and without taking ransom, set her
free to prosecute her voyage.</p>

<p>"271&mdash;If a commander recapture from the enemy
an allied vessel his duty is generally regulated by treaty.
In default of treaty regulations he will send her into a British
port for adjudication and the prize court will award salvage
or not according as the prize court of the ally would or would
not have awarded salvage to an allied ship for recapturing a
British vessel."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER V. GREAT BRITAIN, RECENT ADMINISTRATION.</a></h2>

<h3><a name="Part51" id="Part51"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART 1. PRIZE COURTS.</a></h3>


<p>In regard to the actual administration of these
laws of prize distribution the decisions of prize courts in
cases where the questions of distribution have arisen furnish
the most satisfactory clue to the practice.</p>

<p>It may be well to devote a short space to a
consideration of the organization of courts exercising prize
jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_1_203" id="FNanchor_1_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_203" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> As previously noted, in early times the admiralty
jurisdiction, both administrative and judicial was placed in
the charge of one man, the Lord High Admiral of England. There
were it is true certain favored localities which claimed exemption
from his jurisdiction. Such were the Cinque Ports which
exercised coordinate jurisdiction through their Warden of the
Cinque Ports. To this day the Cinque Ports retain this
privilege<a name="FNanchor_2_204" id="FNanchor_2_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_204" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in some matters, especially questions of civil
salvage but in prize matters, the Warden early lost his authority.</p>

<p>As time went on the Office of Lord High Admiral
began to lose its character of a personal prerogative especially
in the judicial field. The admiralty courts came under the
authority of the king. They exercised instance and prize
jurisdiction without distinction but in the middle of the
seventeenth century the court began to have separate sittings for
the two jurisdictions possibly because of the conflict between
the Droits of the Duke of York as Lord High Admiral and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>King Charles II.<a name="FNanchor_3_205" id="FNanchor_3_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_205" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The administrative duties of the office of Lord
High Admiral were also absorbed by the crown. Throughout the
seventeenth century the office of Admiral was frequently put
in commission. That is, the Lord High Admiral's jurisdiction was
retaken by the king and commissioners were appointed by him to
exercise the duties of the office. By act of 1690<a name="FNanchor_4_206" id="FNanchor_4_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_206" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> express
provision was made for thus disposing of the office of admiralty
and for the most part it has been in commission since.<a name="FNanchor_5_207" id="FNanchor_5_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_207" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> From
this time, therefore, the organization of the department of
admiralty and of admiralty courts has been directly under the
control of the crown in parliament and acts providing for the
institution of prize courts and the distribution of prize money
have been passed by them generally before each war as previously
indicated.<a name="FNanchor_6_208" id="FNanchor_6_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_208" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The history of the admiralty courts of England
has been the history of a struggle between them and the common
law courts, each seeking to increase its jurisdiction at the
expense of the other. Acts were passed in the reign of Richard
II<a name="FNanchor_7_209" id="FNanchor_7_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_209" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> limiting the power of the admiralty courts. Through the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries their power underwent a
constant decline, a fact greatly deplored by Sir Leoline Jenkins
one of the judges of the seventeenth century. The common law courts
even attempted to usurp their jurisdiction in prize matters.
In 1781 however the exclusive jurisdiction of the admiralty
in prize matters was recognized.<a name="FNanchor_8_210" id="FNanchor_8_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_210" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It was at this time that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>Lord Mansfield as Lord Chief Justice of England was beginning to
correlate prize law by his famous decisions in appealed cases.
But it was to Sir William Scott, afterwards Lord Stowell, Judge
of the admiralty and prize court of England during the
Napoleonic wars that the fame of the English Prize Court is
largely due. The English Prize Court was at this time regarded
almost as an international authority, as is witnessed by the
fact that the United States through Ambassador Jay in 1794
requested of England an exposition of prize court procedure for
the use of the United States. The reply of Sir William Scott
and Sir J. Nicholl embodies nearly all the rules adopted by
the United States.<a name="FNanchor_9_211" id="FNanchor_9_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_211" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Of Lord Stowell's work it has been said,
"But his work as a judge of the Prize Court remains to this
day distinct and conspicuous and no changes of international law
can ever diminish his fame as the creator of a great body of
English prize law the only complete and judicially made code in
existence among European nations."<a name="FNanchor_10_212" id="FNanchor_10_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_212" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Through the nineteenth
century the English High Court of admiralty under such judges
as Dr. Stephen Lushington, Sir Robert Phillimore, and Sir Travers
Twiss occupied a position of increasing importance. Its
jurisdiction was greatly increased by a statute of 1840.<a name="FNanchor_11_213" id="FNanchor_11_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_213" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Among
other things it was there given power to adjudicate booty of war
in the same manner as prize. Its jurisdiction was further
enlarged by acts of 1846,<a name="FNanchor_12_214" id="FNanchor_12_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_214" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> 1854,<a name="FNanchor_13_215" id="FNanchor_13_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_215" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> 1861,<a name="FNanchor_14_216" id="FNanchor_14_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_216" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and 1867.<a name="FNanchor_15_217" id="FNanchor_15_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_217" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> By
the Judicature acts of 1873<a name="FNanchor_16_218" id="FNanchor_16_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_218" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and 1875<a name="FNanchor_17_219" id="FNanchor_17_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_219" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the High Court of
Admiralty was incorporated into the High Court of Justice as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>part of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty division of that court.
The Supreme court of judicature act of 1891<a name="FNanchor_18_220" id="FNanchor_18_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_220" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> defined the
prize jurisdiction of the High Court.</p>

<p>Beginning with the establishment of a court in
Jamaica in 1662<a name="FNanchor_19_221" id="FNanchor_19_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_221" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Vice Admiralty courts have been established
in most of the colonies with jurisdiction similar to that of the
courts of admiralty of England. By act of 1832<a name="FNanchor_20_222" id="FNanchor_20_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_222" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> governors of
colonies were made ex-officio vice admirals and the chief
justices of the colonial courts, judges of the courts of vice admiralty.
This act was amended in 1863<a name="FNanchor_21_223" id="FNanchor_21_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_223" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and in 1867.<a name="FNanchor_22_224" id="FNanchor_22_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_224" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> By the Colonial
courts of Admiralty act of 1890<a name="FNanchor_23_225" id="FNanchor_23_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_225" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> all courts of law in British
possessions having unlimited civil jurisdiction were created
courts of admiralty with jurisdiction equal to that of the
Admiralty division of the High court of Justice.</p>

<p>The custom has been to constitute admiralty and
vice admiralty courts into prize courts by special commission on
the outbreak of war. It has been questioned whether a special
commission granting authority to adjudicate prize matters to
the admiralty courts is necessary. Blackstone seems to consider
the authority inherent. He says:</p>

<p>"In case of prizes also in time of war, between
our own nation and another or between two other nations, which
are taken at sea and brought into our ports, the courts of
admiralty have an undisturbed and exclusive jurisdiction to
determine the same according to the laws of nations."<a name="FNanchor_24_226" id="FNanchor_24_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_226" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
Phillimore expresses a similar view.<a name="FNanchor_25_227" id="FNanchor_25_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_227" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> However the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73a" id="Page_73a">[73a]</a></span>opinion seems to be that the prize and instance jurisdiction
of the admiralty courts are separated and the former is granted
only by commission from the crown in time of war.<a name="FNanchor_26_228" id="FNanchor_26_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_228" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Thus the
naval prize act of 1864<a name="FNanchor_27_229" id="FNanchor_27_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_229" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> provides that all admiralty and vice
admiralty courts may be commissioned to act as prize courts during
war under the jurisdiction of the high court of admiralty with
appeal in all cases to the queen in council.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Judicature act of 1891<a name="FNanchor_28_230" id="FNanchor_28_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_230" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
declared the high court to be a prize court within the meaning
of the prize court act of 1864.<a name="FNanchor_29_231" id="FNanchor_29_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_231" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It therefore is a perpetual
prize court and requires no special commission.<a name="FNanchor_30_232" id="FNanchor_30_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_232" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Other admiralty
and vice admiralty courts exercise prize jurisdiction under
provisions of the prize courts act of 1894<a name="FNanchor_31_233" id="FNanchor_31_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_233" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> which declares that
commissions for the establishment of prize courts may be issued
at any time even during peace by the office of admiralty to
become effective on the issuance of a proclamation declaring war.
Laws of procedure may likewise be issued at any time by order
in council in accordance with the provisions of the naval prize
act of 1864.<a name="FNanchor_32_234" id="FNanchor_32_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_234" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>In earliest times the Lord High Admiral of England
and the Warden of the Cinque Ports were the highest appellate
authorities in prize cases in their respective jurisdictions.
Later, appeal apparently lay to the king in chancery but by
1534<a name="FNanchor_33_235" id="FNanchor_33_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_235" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> the custom was established of appointing a special
commission of appeals. This commission was appointed by the crown
and consisted generally of members of the privy council. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>condition prevailed until 1833<a name="FNanchor_34_236" id="FNanchor_34_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_236" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> when the "delegates of appeals"
was abolished and it was provided that all admiralty appeals
whether instance or prize, should lie to the judicial committee
of the privy council. By act of 1832<a name="FNanchor_35_237" id="FNanchor_35_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_237" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> it had been provided that
appeals from all vice admiralty courts lie to the same body.
The naval prize act of 1864<a name="FNanchor_36_238" id="FNanchor_36_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_238" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> likewise provided for appeal to
the queen in council.</p>

<p>After the incorporation of the high court of
admiralty with the High Court of Justice in 1873 it was provided
in the appellate jurisdiction act of 1876<a name="FNanchor_37_239" id="FNanchor_37_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_239" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> that in its instance
jurisdiction appeal lie, as in the other courts, to the High
Court of Appeal and then to the House of Lords. Appeal in
prize cases however was allowed to remain to the privy council
as prescribed by the act of 1864.<a name="FNanchor_38_240" id="FNanchor_38_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_240" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> At present, therefore,
appeal from all prize courts of Great Britain lie ultimately to
the judicial committee of the privy council.</p>

<p>In the Hague Conference of 1907 a convention<a name="FNanchor_39_241" id="FNanchor_39_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_241" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
providing for an international prize court composed of fifteen
judges selected from the leading countries to act as a court of
final appeal in prize cases for all nations was adopted. In
1909 the declaration of London<a name="FNanchor_40_242" id="FNanchor_40_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_242" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> signed by the leading maritime
nations provided definite rules for many unsettled points of
maritime law. Shortly after the meeting of this conference,
autumn of 1910, a bill was proposed in the House of Commons to
reorganize the English prize procedure so as to allow for appeal
to the international court. The bill was defeated.<a name="FNanchor_41_243" id="FNanchor_41_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_243" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>international prize court has not as yet been organized. At
present there is no provision in English law which would permit
of appeal to it in case it came into being. Although her
delegates signed the Convention at the Hague, England has
never officially ratified it and it is difficult to say whether
in case of a war Great Britain would feel bound by this
convention.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_2_THEORY_OF_DISTRIBUTION" id="PART_2_THEORY_OF_DISTRIBUTION"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART 2. THEORY OF DISTRIBUTION.</a></h3>


<h4>a. Relation of state and individual.</h4>

<p>In considering the present theory of prize money
distribution in England and Judicial opinion on the subject, the
classification<a name="FNanchor_1_244" id="FNanchor_1_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_244" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> adopted in summarizing the conclusion of the
Grotian school of international law writers may be used.</p>

<p>1. The state is the only power that can prosecute
war and take prize.</p>

<p>"War must be waged by public authority of the
state and carried on through the agency of those who have been
duly commissioned for that purpose by that authority" says
Phillimore.<a name="FNanchor_2_245" id="FNanchor_2_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_245" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> However this theory appears to be subject to a
good deal of modification in practice as for instance in the
British treatment of captures made by non-commissioned vessels.
England has never given recognition to the theory introduced
by Rousseau and prominent in French political theory that war
is a conflict between the armed forces of the state only and not
between private individuals.<a name="FNanchor_3_246" id="FNanchor_3_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_246" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This theory maintains that the
only participants in war should be the armed representatives of
the state, thus non-belligerent nationals of the enemy country
and their private property should be exempt from military attack.
It seeks to place non-belligerents in practically the same
position as neutrals. Carried to its logical conclusion it would
lead to the complete abolition of the right of capturing enemy
private property at sea, and if not carried to this extreme it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>at any rate incompatible with the grant of prize money to
individuals for if war is solely a state affair aggrandizement of
the individual should not be one of its objects.</p>

<p>This theory of war should be distinguished from
the view of Grotius and his contemporaries. The latter holds
that war is a state affair and can only be entered into by
the state as such but the individual is so closely bound to the
state that if the state is enemy so also is the individual that
belongs to that state. In other words it recognizes no clear
distinction between enemy belligerents and enemy non-belligerents.
"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bellum omnum, contra omnes</span>". Grotius however, did recognize
state non-belligerency or neutrality. This theory though somewhat
modified in practice has been the one adhered to by Great
Britain. She has recognized the complete international
responsibility of the state in war but when she has recognized
non-belligerent rights of enemy subjects it has only been as a
concession in behalf of humanity and contrary to her well
established rights. Thus until very recently she refused to
allow subjects of enemy states any status in her courts. She is
today the firmest opponent of the movement to abolish the practice
of capturing enemy private property at sea and though she asserts
that prize of war belongs to the state, in practice she still
gives it all to the captors thus letting the individual have a
very real personal interest in the war. England now, of course,
recognizes the rights of enemy non-belligerents required by
various international agreements.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<h4>b. Reprisal.</h4>

<p>2. The right of private reprisal can only be
exercised under specific commission from the state.</p>

<p>"And indeed, says Blackstone, this custom of
reprisals seems dictated by nature herself for which reason we
find in the most ancient times very notable instances of it. But
here the necessity is obvious of calling in the sovereign power
to determine when reprisals may be made; else every private
sufferer would be a judge in his own cause."<a name="FNanchor_4_247" id="FNanchor_4_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_247" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In his work on international law Phillimore
gives rules for reprisal in time of peace,<a name="FNanchor_5_248" id="FNanchor_5_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_248" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> saying that the
sovereign alone can grant the right of reprisal and only goods
sufficient to satisfy the debt can be taken, the rest must be
returned. Matters of private reprisal can not be adjudicated in
prize courts, which are only called into existence by regular
war, but come under the jurisdiction of the regular courts of
admiralty.<a name="FNanchor_6_249" id="FNanchor_6_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_249" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The matter is now purely theoretic in England since
by the declaration of Paris of 1856 privateering and consequently
the right of private reprisal was abolished. No commission for
this purpose could now be issued and any one engaged in it would
be considered a pirate. Public reprisal is still used as a
method of coercion short of war and may be employed for the
collection of private debts or for obtaining satisfaction for
torts of the individual, though only vessels of the regular
navy can take part, according to the declaration of Paris.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>The right of reprisal for private redress in
time of peace or special reprisal should be distinguished from
the right of reprisal during war or general reprisal, sometimes
distinguished as the right of Marque. Formerly vessels were
commissioned by letters of Marque and reprisal to prey on the
general commerce of the enemy to any extent and wherever found
during war. This right was only legal under special commission
of the sovereign though England seems to have taken a very
lenient attitude in dealing with non-commissioned captors
even granting them a share of their prizes. Her attitude seems
to have been that subjects by making captures without commission
offended against municipal law but not against international law.
Thus she was at liberty to deal with them as she chose but the
injured alien had no recourse under international law. As a
matter of fact if the non-commissioned captors had observed due
care in the conduct of the prize they were usually rewarded
with prize money on its condemnation.<a name="FNanchor_7_250" id="FNanchor_7_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_250" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The declaration of Paris
which abolished this practice was severely criticized by many
English writers on the ground that it robbed England of important
belligerent rights and some even doubted whether England was
legally bound by it on account of some diplomatic irregularities
in signing it.<a name="FNanchor_8_251" id="FNanchor_8_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_251" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But now there can be little doubt but that
privateering is illegal in England though volunteer fleets and
subsidized steamship lines which are used by all naval powers,
come dangerously near to amounting to the same thing.<a name="FNanchor_9_252" id="FNanchor_9_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_252" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<h4>c. State Title to Prize.</h4>

<p>The title to all prize vests originally in the state.</p>

<p>Phillimore says, "The maxim '<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bello Parta Cedunt
Reipublicae</span>,' is recognized by all civilized states. In England
all acquisitions of war belong to the sovereign who represents
the commonwealth. The Sovereign is the fountain of booty and
prize."<a name="FNanchor_10_253" id="FNanchor_10_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_253" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Holland makes a similar statement: "Most systems of
law hold that property taken from an enemy vests primarily in
the nation, '<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bello Parta Cedunt Reipublicae</span>'. A rule which is
the foundation of the law of booty and prize."<a name="FNanchor_11_254" id="FNanchor_11_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_254" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The same view
has been expressed by the court as follows:</p>

<p>"That prize is clearly and distinctly the property
of the crown and the sovereign in this country, the executive
government in all countries in whom is vested the power of levying
the forces of the state and of making war and peace, is alone
possessed of all property in prize, is a principle not to be
disputed.&mdash;&mdash; It is equally clear that the title of a party
claiming prize must needs in all cases be the act of the crown,
by which the royal pleasure to grant the prize shall have been
signified to the subject."<a name="FNanchor_12_255" id="FNanchor_12_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_255" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But this principle is carried further
and even after an express grant of prize money has been made the
crown still has exclusive control over prize. In other words the
grant of prize money creates no legal right which the captor
can maintain against the pleasure or whim of the crown. In the
case of "The Elsebe"<a name="FNanchor_13_256" id="FNanchor_13_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_256" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Sir William Scott said:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>"It is admitted on the part of the captors that
their claim rests wholly on the order of council, the proclamation
and the prize act. It is not denied that independent of these
instruments the whole subject matter is in the hands of the crown
as well in point of interest as in point of authority. Prize is
altogether a creature of the crown. No man has or can have
any interest, but what he takes as the mere gift of the crown.
Beyond the extent of that gift he has nothing.&mdash;&mdash; This is the
principle of law on the subject and founded on the wisest reasons.
The right of making war and peace is exclusively in the crown.
The acquisitions of war belong to the crown and the disposal
of these acquisitions may be of utmost importance for the
purposes both of war and peace. This is no peculiar doctrine of
our constitution, it is universally received as a necessary
principle of public jurisprudence by all writers on the subject.&mdash;&mdash; <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bello
parta cedunt reipublicae</span>&mdash;&mdash; It is not to be
supposed that the wise attribute of sovereignty is conferred
without reason; it is given for the purpose assigned that the
power to whom it belongs to decided peace or war may use it in
the most beneficial manner for the purposes of both. A general
presumption arising from these considerations is that the
government does not mean to divest itself of this universal
attribute of sovereignty conferred for such purposes unless it is
so clearly and unequivocally expressed.&mdash;&mdash;For these reasons
the crown has declared that till after adjudication the captor
has no interest which the court can properly notice for any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>legal effect whatsoever." From considerations of public policy
the judge considers that the sacrifice of this inalienable right
of the crown would be apt to lead to constant international
differences or even war and concludes "I am of opinion that all
principles of law, all considerations of public policy, concur to
support the right of release prior to adjudication which I must
pronounce to be still inherent in the crown." As based on
policy and international law this decision was no doubt correct
and necessary, but it seems more doubtful whether from the
standpoint of English law either a court or the royal prerogative
can divest a property right which has been unequivocally granted
by act of parliament, as appears to have been done in the case
of the act here in question.<a name="FNanchor_14_257" id="FNanchor_14_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_257" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> However under the present prize
act the crowns rights are expressly reserved so there could now
be no question. It therefore appears that at present England
recognizes the absolute title of the crown to all prizes, until
after decree of distribution.</p>


<h4>d. Adjudication of Prizes.</h4>

<p>Distribution should be decreed only after
adjudication of the prize by a competent tribunal of the state.
Benedict has said "Before property captured can be properly
disposed of it must be condemned as prize in a regular judicial
proceeding in which all parties interested may be heard."<a name="FNanchor_15_258" id="FNanchor_15_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_258" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The letter<a name="FNanchor_16_259" id="FNanchor_16_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_259" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> of Sir J. Nicholl and Sir William Scott
to United States Ambassador Jay authoritatively states British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>opinion. The portion given was quoted by the authors from a
report made by a commission to the king in 1753.</p>

<p>"Before the ship or goods can be disposed of by
the captors there must be a regular judicial proceeding,
wherein both parties may be heard, and condemnation thereupon
as prize in a court of admiralty, judging by the law of nations
and treaties.</p>

<p>"The proper and regular court for these
condemnations is the court of that state to whom the captor
belongs.</p>

<p>"If the sentence of the court of admiralty is
thought to be erroneous, there is in every country a superior
court of review consisting of the most considerable persons to
which the parties who think themselves aggrieved may appeal,
and the superior court judges by the same rule which governs
the court of admiralty, viz. the law of nations, and the treaties
subsisting with that neutral power whose subject is a party
before them.</p>

<p>"If no appeal is offered it is an acknowledgement
of the justice of the sentence by the parties themselves and
conclusive.</p>

<p>"In this method all captures at sea were tried
during the last war by Great Britain, France, and Spain and
submitted to by the neutral powers. In this method by courts
of admiralty acting according to the law of nations and particular
treaties all captures at sea have immemorially been judged
of in every country in Europe. Any other method of trial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>would be manifestly unjust, absurd and impracticable."</p>

<p>In regard to the competency of courts this subject
is now dealt with by statute. It has been judicially stated
that no British subject can maintain an action in a municipal
court against the captors for prize. The court of admiralty
is the proper tribunal and it exercises prize jurisdiction
only under special commission from the crown.<a name="FNanchor_17_260" id="FNanchor_17_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_260" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In 1801 a case
arose in which a vessel was condemned as prize and the proceeds
distributed by decree of the vice admiralty court of Santa
Domingo.<a name="FNanchor_18_261" id="FNanchor_18_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_261" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It appeared that the court had no commission to act
as a prize court. On retrial the British prize court said:</p>

<p>"But the court having no authority those proceedings
are nill and of no legal effect whatsoever." In spite of this
decision Phillimore expresses the opinion that in the absence of
a special commission the regular courts of admiralty could
legally exercise prize jurisdiction according to ancient custom.<a name="FNanchor_19_262" id="FNanchor_19_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_262" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Under the present law there can be no question as to what courts
are commissioned. It therefore appears to be established that
English jurisprudence demands a judicial adjudication by a
duly commissioned court before distribution of prize money.</p>


<h4>e. Method of Distribution.</h4>

<p>The method of distributing prize money is determined
by municipal law.</p>

<p>The statutory regulations and orders in council
decreeing the method of distribution in England together with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>instructions to naval commanders have already been noted.<a name="FNanchor_20_263" id="FNanchor_20_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_263" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
A brief consideration of their judicial interpretation may throw
some additional light on the actual method of determining the
shares of prize received by the captors.</p>

<p>Benefit may be received by the captors or
destroyers of vessels in three ways. 1. As prize bounty. A
special reward is often given for destroying or capturing enemy
vessels. Usually it is given only for destroying armed vessels
of the enemy though in some cases, bounty has also been given
for the destruction of merchantmen. It is a sum of money given
from the treasury of the government irrespective of the value of
the prize captured. In distributing it an effort is made to
determine the strength of the opposing vessel, thus it is given
either as gun money, a fixed amount for each gun on the enemy
vessel or as head money, a fixed amount for each man on the
enemy vessel at the beginning of the engagement. 2. As military
salvage. A reward is usually given for the recapture and return
of vessels belonging to citizens of their own or allied countries.
This reward is of a similar nature to the salvage which is
ordinarily paid for the recovery of shipwrecked vessels in time
of peace. The amount paid is usually a certain proportion of
the total value of the recaptured prize. 3. As prize money.
This is the portion of the actual proceeds of the prize captured
given to the captors. The amount of benefit in this case would
of course depend on the value of the prize captured, and if the
prize is destroyed there obviously is no prize money. Formerly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>money might also be received as ransom, that is a prize would be
released by the captors on the giving of a ransom bill which
obligated the master of the prize to continue to a certain port,
to refrain from future voyages during the war, and to pay a
fixed sum of money as ransom. Thus ransom would partake of the
nature of prize money and be divided in the same way. The
practice was abolished in England in 1782 by statute<a name="FNanchor_21_264" id="FNanchor_21_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_264" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> but seems
to have been allowed later in special cases<a name="FNanchor_22_265" id="FNanchor_22_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_265" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> though each
succeeding prize statute repeated the prohibition. It is now
illegal unless specially authorized by Order in Council under
the naval prize act of 1864.<a name="FNanchor_23_266" id="FNanchor_23_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_266" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<h3><a name="PART_4_PRIZE_SALVAGE" id="PART_4_PRIZE_SALVAGE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART 4. PRIZE SALVAGE.</a></h3>


<p>Whether or not military salvage is paid depends
upon (1) the character of the original captor, whether recognized
belligerent or pirate, (2) the character of the original owner
of the vessel whether neutral, subject, or ally, (3) the character
of the title the original captor has in the vessel.</p>

<p>In regard to the first point it may be said that
recaptures from pirates or unrecognized belligerents should
always be returned to the original owner on the payment of salvage.
Pirates can never acquire any title in a capture, so the title
of the original owner remains good. We need therefore consider
only recapture from recognized belligerents.</p>

<p>In the case of recapture of neutral vessels the
original captor had no title and could get none. A prize court of
his own country would have decreed restitution of the vessel to
the original owner so the recaptor has conferred no benefit by
recapturing the vessel. He therefore is entitled to no salvage.
In cases, however where no legal prize court exists in the country
of the original captor the recaptor does the original owner benefit
so should be rewarded by salvage. This situation was held to
have existed in France in 1799 and in a case<a name="FNanchor_1_269" id="FNanchor_1_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_269" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which came up at
that time Sir William Scott speaking for the British prize court
said:</p>

<p>"I know perfectly well that it is not the modern
practice of the law of nations to grant salvage on recapture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>of neutral vessels; and upon this plain principle that the
liberation of a clear neutral from the hand of the enemy is no
essential service rendered to him, inasmuch as that same enemy
would be compelled by the tribunals of his own country, after
he had carried the neutral into port to release him with costs
and damages for the injurious seizure and detention." However
in the case before the court the French courts were held to
be incompetent so salvage was awarded the captor.</p>

<p>In recapture of vessels originally belonging to
subjects, most countries make distinctions in reference to the
character of the original captors title. However Great Britain
has provided by statute that recaptures shall always revert to
the original owner when a subject on payment of salvage with
the one exception that in case the vessel has been fitted out
by the enemy as a ship of war it shall not be returned but shall
be declared good prize.<a name="FNanchor_2_270" id="FNanchor_2_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_270" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The final case remains of recaptures of vessels
of an ally. Here the question of the original captor's title
enters in, for if the original captor had good title, the vessel
is enemy property and should be condemned as good prize to the
benefit of the recaptor; but if the title of the original captor
is incomplete the original owner still has a certain title
which must be respected. The question therefore arises, when
is the original captor's title complete? There have been
many rules on the subject. Thus Sir William Scott has said:</p>

<p>"It can not be forgotten that by the ancient law
of Europe the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">perductio infra praesidia, infra locum tutum</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>was a sufficient conversion of the property, that by a later
law a possession of twenty-four hours was sufficient to divest
the former owner. This is laid down in the 287th article of
the Consolato Del Mare in terms not very intelligible in
themselves but which are satisfactorily explained by Grotius
and by his commentator Barbeyrac in his notes upon that article."<a name="FNanchor_3_271" id="FNanchor_3_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_271" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Sir Leoline Jenkins, in 1672 said:</p>

<p>"In England we have not the letter of any law for
our direction only I could never find that the court of
admiralty either before the late troubles or since has in
these cases adjudged the ships of one subject good prize to
another." He then refers to the Commonwealth laws of 1649
and says, "Whether the usurpers intended this as a new law or an
affirmance of the ancient custom of England I will not take
upon me to determine, only I will say, condemnation upon the
enemies possession for twenty-four hours is a modern usage."<a name="FNanchor_4_272" id="FNanchor_4_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_272" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Later legal adjudication and condemnation was clearly required
before the title of the captor state was complete. Thus Lord
Mansfield said:</p>

<p>"I have talked with Sir George Lee who has
examined the books of the court of admiralty and he informs me
that they hold the property not changed, so as to bar the owner
in favor of a vendee or recaptor till there had been a sentence
of condemnation, and that in the reign of Charles II, Sir
Richard Floyd gave a solemn judgment upon the property and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>decided restitution of a ship retaken by a privateer after she
had been fourteen weeks in the enemies possession because she
had not been condemned."<a name="FNanchor_5_273" id="FNanchor_5_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_273" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> And again "That no property vest in
any goods taken at sea or on land by a ship or her crew, till
a sentence of condemnation as good and lawful prize."<a name="FNanchor_6_274" id="FNanchor_6_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_274" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> These
cases referred to vessels owned by subjects rather than allies
as they occurred before the law granting especial restitution to
citizens had been passed but they serve to make it clear that
English law regards the title of the enemy captor complete and
the title of the original owner destroyed after legal
condemnation in the enemy prize court and not before. Vessels
originally belonging to allies after such condemnation will be
considered good prize and the ally has no claim. There is no
question of salvage, instead the captor receives his share of
prize money. Recaptures before the enemy title is complete
revert to the ally on payment of salvage but if instances can be
given of British property retaken by them and condemned as
prize, the court of admiralty will determine the case according
to their own rule.<a name="FNanchor_7_275" id="FNanchor_7_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_275" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Thus the recaptor may receive no reward at all,
may be entitled to salvage or may be entitled to prize money.</p>

<p>The first case occurs when a neutral vessel is
recaptured from a recognized belligerent.</p>

<p>The second occurs when the recapture is made from
a pirate, when the original owner is a British subject, or when
the original owner is an ally and the vessel has not been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>condemned by the enemy's prize court.</p>

<p>The third case occurs when the vessel originally
belonged to an ally but has been legally condemned by the enemy
prize court and in any case of an ally's vessel where that
country refuses to return British vessels.</p>

<p>To be entitled to salvage the recaptor must make
an actual military recapture. Constructive recaptures such as
occupation of a vessel abandoned by the enemy do not entitle
to military salvage.<a name="FNanchor_8_276" id="FNanchor_8_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_276" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>As already stated where salvage is allowed it
consists of one-eighth of the value of the vessel and cargo
recaptured or in cases of exceptional difficulty one-fourth to
be governed by the discretion of the court.<a name="FNanchor_9_277" id="FNanchor_9_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_277" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Salvage is
apportioned among the officers and crew in the same manner
as prize money.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_5_PRIZE_MONEY" id="PART_5_PRIZE_MONEY"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART 5. PRIZE MONEY.</a></h3>


<p>Whenever a vessel or cargo is adjudged good prize
by the court it is publicly sold and the proceeds are decreed to
the captors as prize money, unless they are non-commissioned or
forfeit it by failure to observe the regulations imposed upon
them for the conduct and safe keeping of the prize.<a name="FNanchor_1_278" id="FNanchor_1_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_278" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In England
the proceeds of all vessels and cargoes, whether of a purely
mercantile or of a military character are divided as prize money,
though the government reserves the right of preemption on naval
and victualling stores.<a name="FNanchor_2_279" id="FNanchor_2_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_279" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The rules which govern the prize court
in adjudging a captured vessel good prize or not are beyond the
scope of this paper. In general all enemy vessels are condemned,
and neutral vessels are condemned for breach of blockade, carriage
of contraband or unneutral service. These matters are at present
largely covered by the Hague conventions of 1907 and the
Declaration of London of 1909.<a name="FNanchor_3_280" id="FNanchor_3_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_280" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> However as previously noted
the crown reserves the right to free any vessel even though its
capture was perfectly legal and it was of a class that would
ordinarily be adjudged good prize.<a name="FNanchor_4_281" id="FNanchor_4_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_281" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In the distribution of prize money there must be
decided, first, what vessels are to share in the prize; second,
what proportion each vessel is to get, and third, what proportion
of the vessels share each officer and man on board is to receive.</p>

<p>The second and third points are settled by the
prize proclamation which decrees division among the officers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>and men of all the vessels sharing according to the grade they
occupy. There is no division among the vessels but all men
entitled to share are grouped together in eleven grades, each one
of which receives a fixed proportion of the prize money. This
portion is then divided equally among all the men of that grade,
no matter on what vessel they served. Thus a sailor on a vessel
constructively assisting receives exactly the same share as a
sailor of the same grade on the vessel making the actual capture.<a name="FNanchor_5_282" id="FNanchor_5_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_282" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Where some of the vessels are allies the division
is usually regulated by treaty. The provisions of Great Britain's
treaties with France of 1854 and 1860 have already been noted.<a name="FNanchor_6_283" id="FNanchor_6_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_283" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
In these cases division was to be made between the vessels of
the allies according to the number of men on board irrespective
of rank. Of course, for the share decreed to her own vessels,
England employed her own rules of division. Where there is no
treaty or some of the vessels are privateers the division among
the vessels is decreed by the court, an effort being made to
apportion it according to the relative strength of the vessels.
To determine this the number of men, guns or both on the various
vessels are considered. Thus Mansfield said,</p>

<p>"The law of nations does not determine but if one
might guess at it, it must be in the ratio of the strength of the
respective captors, to know which the number of guns, weight
of metal, number of men and strength of each fleet must be
stated."<a name="FNanchor_7_284" id="FNanchor_7_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_284" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The court must decide the first question proposed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>namely what vessels were either actual or joint captors and as
such entitled to share. In defining these terms the court has
said:</p>

<p>"All prize belongs absolutely to the crown which for
the last 150 years has been in the habit of granting it to the
takers who are of two classes, actual captors and joint or
constructive captors. Joint captors are those who have assisted
or are taken to have assisted the actual captors by conveying
encouragement to them or intimidation to the enemy."<a name="FNanchor_8_285" id="FNanchor_8_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_285" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It is
in general considered that this encouragement or intimidation is
given by all vessels in sight but this is not always true. Thus:</p>

<p>"For it is perfectly clear that being in sight of
all cases is not sufficient. What is the real and true
criteria?&mdash;&mdash; There must be some actual, constructive endeavor
as well as a general intention."<a name="FNanchor_9_286" id="FNanchor_9_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_286" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>But in the case of king's ships all in sight generally
share.</p>

<p>"They are under a constant obligation to attack the
enemy whenever seen. A neglect of duty is not to be presumed
and therefore from the mere circumstance of being in sight
a presumption is sufficiently raised that they are there <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">animo
capiendi</span>."<a name="FNanchor_10_287" id="FNanchor_10_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_287" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> This rule holds irrespective of the character of
the vessel making the actual capture.</p>

<p>With privateers the case is different:</p>

<p>"For they are not under obligation to fight. It
must be shown in their case that they were constructively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>assisting. The being in sight is not sufficient with respect
to them to raise a presumption of cooperation in capture.&mdash;There
must be the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">animus capiendi</span> demonstrated by some overt
act, by some variation of conduct which would not have taken
place but with reference to that particular object and if the
intention of acting against the enemy had not been effectually
entertained."<a name="FNanchor_11_288" id="FNanchor_11_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_288" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> As privateering has been abolished this rule
is now purely theoretical.</p>

<p>These rules are subject to exceptions however as
for instance in the case of captures made in the night or
after a joint chase. In such cases ships of the navy definitely
associated share though not in sight. Thus:</p>

<p>"A fleet so associated is considered as one body
unless detached by orders or entirely separated by accident
and what is done by one continuing to compose in fact a part
of the fleet, enures to the benefit of all."<a name="FNanchor_12_289" id="FNanchor_12_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_289" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>A vessel shares in the captures of its tenders.</p>

<p>"I apprehend that the tender becomes as has been
contended in law a part of the ship to which she has been
attached and that any capture made by her enures to the benefit
of the ship to which the tender is an adjunct."<a name="FNanchor_13_290" id="FNanchor_13_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_290" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Tenders
are usually non-commissioned vessels but as they are considered
agents of a commissioned vessel their captures are good. The
same is true of captures made by ships boats but no constructive
captures are allowed by boats of other vessels in sight.</p>

<p>Transport vessels do not participate as joint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>captors. A case involving transports arose in 1799. The court
said:</p>

<p>"It has not been shown that these ships set out in
an originally military character, or that any military character
has been subsequently impressed upon them by the nature and
course of their employment and therefore, however meritorious
their services may have been and however entitled they may be
to the gratitude of their country it will not entitle them to
share in this valuable capture."<a name="FNanchor_14_291" id="FNanchor_14_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_291" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The division of captures made by joint naval and
military expedition are under the jurisdiction of prize courts.
So far as possible the same principles of division are employed
in dividing proceeds among soldiers of the army as in dividing
prize money in the navy. In regard to the conditions that
permit a joint land expedition to share the court said in 1799:</p>

<p>"Much more is necessary than a mere being to sight
to entitle an army to share jointly with the navy in the
capture of an enemy's fleet". A common interest is presumed
with naval vessels in sight, not so with the army. "The
services must be such as were directly or materially influencing
the capture so that the capture could not have been made without
such assistance or at least not certainly and without great
hazard."<a name="FNanchor_15_292" id="FNanchor_15_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_292" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The prize act of 1864 now governs the division in
joint military and naval captures.<a name="FNanchor_16_293" id="FNanchor_16_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_293" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Captures made by non-commissioned ships which now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>includes all vessels not part of the royal navy go to the
government.<a name="FNanchor_17_294" id="FNanchor_17_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_294" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Such captures were originally one of the Droits
of Admiralty<a name="FNanchor_18_295" id="FNanchor_18_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_295" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> but since the office of admiral has been in
commission they enure to the crown. Peculiarly enough, though
all such forfeitures now go to the crown the technical
distinction of condemnation to the king, jure coronae and
condemnation to the king in his office of admiralty. Droits
of Admiralty is still maintained in the decrees of prize courts.
By statute<a name="FNanchor_19_296" id="FNanchor_19_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_296" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> all such Droits of Admiralty and Jure Coronae are
now put into the consolidated fund of Great Britain. In
practice it has usually happened that the greater part of the
proceeds of captures made by non-commissioned captors is given
to the captor as a special reward.<a name="FNanchor_20_297" id="FNanchor_20_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_297" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> For this it appears that
England does not recognize an international obligation to
prevent captures by non-commissioned vessels in time of war.
It is hard to reconcile this attitude with her adoption of the
Declaration of Paris in 1856. She does not of course issue
letters of Marque or officially permit capture by any vessels
other than those of the royal navy. England has not been engaged
in any important naval war since the treaty of Paris so it is
impossible to say exactly what her practice in this regard would
be. Legally all rights in captures by non-commissioned captors
enure to the crown so if such vessels infringed on neutral
rights England would undoubtedly refuse to give them any reward,
which would soon have the effect of stopping such captures.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<p>Definite rules are prescribed for the conduct of
prizes, as for instance, the cargoes must not be tampered with,
the holds must be closed, all necessary papers must be presented
with the prize, the prize must be brought in without delay and
proceedings must be commenced in the prize court without unreasonable
delay.<a name="FNanchor_21_298" id="FNanchor_21_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_298" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>"It is to be observed that the captors have no
right to convert property till it has been brought to legal
adjudication. They are not even to break bulk."<a name="FNanchor_22_299" id="FNanchor_22_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_299" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>"The captor holds but an imperfect right; the property
may turn out to belong to others, and if the captor put it in
an improper place or keeps it with too little attention he must
be liable to the consequences if the goods are not kept with the
same caution with which a prudent person would keep his own
property."<a name="FNanchor_23_300" id="FNanchor_23_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_300" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Negligence on the part of the captors in caring for
the prize or infringement of national or international laws on
the subject will result in the forfeiture of all share of the
prize<a name="FNanchor_24_301" id="FNanchor_24_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_301" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and indeed as already observed<a name="FNanchor_25_302" id="FNanchor_25_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_302" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> without any fault on
the part of the captor the crown may refuse the captors any
share by returning the vessel as a matter of policy. This almost
always occurs at the close of a war when it is usually provided
by treaty that unadjudicated prizes should be returned. The
captor's rights in prize are purely at the mercy of the crown.
What he receives he receives by the crown's grace and not by
legal right.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER VI. GREAT BRITAIN, SIGNIFICANCE<br />
OF PRESENT LAW.</a></h2>

<h3><a name="Part61" id="Part61"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART 1. CAUSES OF LAW.</a></h3>


<p>As has been indicated since the beginning of the
eighteenth century the principles of prize distribution in
England have undergone but little alteration. With the statutes
of Anne parliamentary control of prize matters became
established and the method at that time adopted of decreeing
distribution by order in council authorized by act of parliament
has since been followed. The policy of giving all the proceeds
of prizes to the captors after legal adjudication before a
competent prize court has likewise been adhered to from that time.</p>

<p>By the reign of Anne, England was definitely
established as an imperial colonial power. Her Indian empire
was founded, her American colonies were flourishing, Marlborough's
successful wars gave her great European prestige. This
necessitated the establishment of a policy of naval supremacy,
a policy which she has since maintained. At the same time she
realised her increasing dependence on commerce. Numerous
efforts were made to increase British trade at this time through
legislation. She understood that law must reign on the sea if
commerce was to prosper.<a name="FNanchor_1_303" id="FNanchor_1_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_303" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> While she depended on her navy to
protect her trade routes, she recognized that she could not
protect them from the cruisers of all the world and so sought
to respect neutral rights. This necessity was realized slowly.
During the eighteenth century in pursuing her aggressive naval
policy England several times offended neutral powers as for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>instance by the rule of 1756 but in the main neutral rights were
respected and prizes were not taken or distributed except with
the strict sanction of law.</p>

<p>Thus as in former periods England's military policy
has been influenced by the two factors, commercial dependence
and naval aggressiveness. The interests of the former have
compelled her to respect neutral rights and maintain strict
legality in all her war-like measures. As reflected in her
prize law it has brought about powerful legal control of prize
matters through prize courts of great authority and unfailing
justice. It has forced the crown to assert its primal right
to all prizes that it may restore them if policy demands. It
has put all prize law under the control of parliamentary
statutes, directing the policy of the law but has left the
government wide discretion in arranging the details to suit the
exigencies of a particular conflict.</p>

<p>The interests of the latter have impelled her to
assert belligerent rights to the utmost. England has always
been the most reluctant of all nations to abandon an established
belligerent right at sea.<a name="FNanchor_2_304" id="FNanchor_2_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_304" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Thus she still gives the whole of
the proceeds of legally captured prizes to the captors for the
purpose of encouraging seamen, and increasing the efficiency of
the navy.</p>

<h3><a name="PART_2_EFFECTS_OF_LAW" id="PART_2_EFFECTS_OF_LAW"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PART 2. EFFECTS OF LAW.</a></h3>


<h4>a. The Navy</h4>

<p>To discuss the effects of England's prize money
law is a very difficult task. However a few remarks may be made
considering the question with reference to its effect, first,
on the English navy and second, on international law.</p>

<p>It might be thought that the encouragement of
mariners by the hope of private gain would tend to increase the
efficiency of the navy and this is the avowed purpose of
distribution in all the statutes authorizing it. England has
undoubtedly always had a very efficient navy but she has almost
always found it necessary to use the press gang<a name="FNanchor_1_305" id="FNanchor_1_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_305" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to man her
vessels in her important naval wars. The hope of prize money
has not been sufficient to furnish enough volunteers to fill
the navy.</p>

<p>In connection with privateering there can be no
doubt but that the generous giving of prizes has enabled England
to make effective war with little national expense. Elizabeth's
wars cost her nothing, rather they were a source of income. The
same was true of the wars of the eighteenth century. The hope
of gain seemed always sufficient to enlist private enterprise
in privateering war. However privateering is now abolished.
Modern naval strategy demands a few men-of-war rather than many
cruisers. Captain Mahan<a name="FNanchor_2_306" id="FNanchor_2_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_306" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> considers commercial war as of
comparatively small importance. An effective blow can only be
struck by conflict with the enemy's armed vessels. Any amount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>of commerce destroying can not conclude the war in his opinion,
though he by no means takes the stand that commerce destroying
should be abolished. It would seem that the small share of
prize which might possibly be received by a sailor in a modern
ship would be a negligible factor in increasing naval
efficiency. Rather it would be a deterrent as it would attract
vessels into commercial war instead of into the more effective
conflicts with the enemy's armed vessels. With the abolition
of privateering it would seem that the value of prize money as
a means of increasing the efficiency of the navy departed.</p>


<h4>b. International Law.</h4>

<p>England's prize money laws can not be said to
have imperiled neutral rights. England has always insisted
on the most extreme belligerent rights but it can not be said
that her courts often denied a neutral right that was really
established by international law. The prize courts of Mansfield
and Stowell have been considered models of fairness throughout
the world. Though the utmost privileges were given to
privateers and the sailors of the royal navy the even handed
justice of the prize courts fully protected neutral rights
by restoring illegal captures made with the hope of private gain.
With a people of less law abiding disposition and less used to
submission to law than the English this might not be true.</p>

<p>It might be supposed that the generosity toward
the captors of prize would be calculated to decrease the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>destruction of prizes at sea. If the prize were destroyed of
course the captor would obtain no prize money. English publicists
are inclined to admit the right of destruction at sea. Thus
Scott, Lushington and Holland say that it should not be resorted
to except in cases of extreme urgency but on occasion it may be
justifiable or even praiseworthy.<a name="FNanchor_3_307" id="FNanchor_3_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_307" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Continental writers on the
contrary are inclined to disallow entirely the legality of the
destruction of prizes. Bluntschli and Heffter greatly deprecate
the practice.<a name="FNanchor_4_308" id="FNanchor_4_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_308" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In spite of the apparent authority for such
action given by English publicists English cruisers have very
seldom destroyed prizes. This may be due partly to her prize
money law but probably to a greater extent to her widely scattered
territories which make it almost always possible to get a prize
to an English port. At present the destruction of neutral prizes
is closely circumscribed by the provisions of the Declaration of
London<a name="FNanchor_5_309" id="FNanchor_5_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_309" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> on that point so it is not likely that the abolition of
prize money would bring about an increase in this practice.</p>

<p>The movement toward the abolition of the right
to capture enemy private property at sea, historically advocated
by the United States, is coming into increasing favor in England,
though England as a nation always has been and still is the
leading opponent of the innovation.<a name="FNanchor_6_310" id="FNanchor_6_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_310" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> As pointed out above,
modern naval strategy deprecates commercial war as also does
humanitarianism. A considerable number of English publicists are
now advocating the abolition of this right not only on behalf
of humanity but also as a matter of wise military policy for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>Great Britain. The increasing importance of unrestrained
commerce to the island has influenced many to believe that England
would gain more than she would lose by the abandonment of this
belligerent right.<a name="FNanchor_7_311" id="FNanchor_7_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_311" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>It may be useful to consider how much effect the
institution of prize money has upon England's attitude on this
question. There is no doubt but that sailors and officers of the
navy like to get prize money. There is the gambler's zest to money
received in this way and undoubtedly the personnel of the navy
would offer all the resistance in their power to the abolishment
of prize money. A section in the proposed prize act of 1910
illustrates this.</p>

<p>The act was offered in order to permit of the
appeal of prize cases to the international prize court provided
for by the Hague conference of 1907. The section in question<a name="FNanchor_8_312" id="FNanchor_8_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_312" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
authorized the admiralty to give prize money on estimated value
even when the prize was liberated by the court. The object of
this section was evidently to insure reward to the captors in
case of a possible undue liberality on the part of the international
prize court, and would seem to imply a certain lack of confidence
in that court. This bill was lost with little discussion.
However, the provision indicates that the element favoring prize
money is ready to push its interests in legislation.</p>

<p>If the war right of capturing private enemy property
at sea were abandoned the chance of getting prize money would
automatically disappear except in the comparatively rare cases of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>contraband and breach of blockade. Is the naval sentiment
in favor of prize money strong enough to keep England from
falling in with other nations in this movement toward abolishing
the right of capture at sea? It does not seem likely. The
selfish, personal desires of a small portion of the population
can not be sufficient to sway the policy of a great nation like
England if broader considerations demand a change. England's
resistance to the movement for abolishing the right to capture
private property at sea can be traced to other causes. John
Stuart Mill once called the right to attack commerce "our chief
defensive weapon."<a name="FNanchor_9_313" id="FNanchor_9_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_313" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Phillimore, Twiss, Westlake, and Lorimer
all favored the retention of the right. It is idle to suppose
that these men had no stronger reason for their stand than that
it permitted seamen to get prize money. From the standpoint
of military science there has been in the past justification
for the retention of this right by England, and many sincerely
believe that even now England must retain it as a military
defense.</p>

<p>In the vote on the American proposition for abolishing
this right of capture taken at the Second Hague conference<a name="FNanchor_10_314" id="FNanchor_10_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_314" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
the prize money laws of the different countries apparently had
no effect on their vote. Italy and Sweden who give prize money
as well as the United States and Germany who do not favored
the resolution. On the other hand, Japan who has never given
prize money voted against the proposal as also did Great Britain,
France and Russia who have always given it. It should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>remembered that the United States advocated the abolition of
the right to capture private property at sea for a century before
she abolished prize money. Italy also has consistently advocated
that policy since 1870 though she still gives prize money.<a name="FNanchor_11_315" id="FNanchor_11_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_315" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
It does not seem that the local law of prize money has any
great effect on the countries attitude on the question of the
right to capture private property at sea.</p>

<p>As stated there is a growing movement in England
in favor of abandoning the right of capturing private property
at sea. The discussion has been entirely based on considerations
of broad national policy. The existence of prize money has
not entered into the matter. It does not seem likely that
England's laws of prize money have had or do now have any
appreciable influence on her attitude in this question.</p>


<h4>c. Conclusion.</h4>

<p>It seems that under present conditions the giving
of prize money in England has little effect either for good or
evil. Since the abolition of privateering it appears to have
had little value in increasing the efficiency of the navy or in
decreasing the expense of war. Neutral rights have not been
imperiled by it for in England it has not given rise to biased
judgment on illegal captures. While it may have decreased the
destruction of prizes before adjudication it does not appear
likely that its abandonment would now have any effect on this
matter. Neither does it seem probable that it has had much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>influence in determining England's stand on the question of the
right to capture private enemy property at sea.</p>

<p>In view of this inoffensive character of prize
money in England it is not surprising that it remains law.
Sailors and naval officers want to keep it. The institution is
long established in custom by which the English are proverbially
bound. Unless a definite charge can be brought against it, it
does not seem likely that the present practice will be abolished.
England's stand at the Hague conference of 1907 seemed to indicate
this attitude. On that occasion a proposition was introduced
by the French delegation to abolish prize money.<a name="FNanchor_12_316" id="FNanchor_12_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_316" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It was
offered as a substitute to the American plan of abolishing the
right to capture private property at sea. Great Britain
opposed the scheme. Sir Ernest Satow, the British delegate, said
that England could not agree to the proposition as the English
parliament had reasons for believing in their present custom of
distribution. The reasons, he did not give. He added that he
considered the matter as being one solely for internal settlement
and not one of international law.<a name="FNanchor_13_317" id="FNanchor_13_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_317" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> We may therefore expect
prize money to remain as an institution of British policy,
though its influence on international law seems to be very slight.</p>

<p>On theoretical grounds the practice seems to have
little basis for existing. It is not in harmony with the modern
view of war which seeks so far as possible to eliminate the
element of personal gain and to limit the operations of war to
strictly state agencies. It encourages war on commerce. Its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>use savors of privateering. It offers a constant temptation
for infringing neutral rights by making illegal captures.
With the abolition of privateering and the present views of
naval strategy its usefulness as an encouragement for seamen and
a means of increasing the efficiency of the navy have departed.
It accentuates the gambler's chance which is contrary to all
modern ethics. Sailors, the same as soldiers, should receive
fixed pay for their services, and not be compelled to rely for
their salaries, in part at least, upon the uncertain chance of
prize money. Bentwich says of prize money: "The present custom
of dividing among the captors the proceeds of sale after
adjudication of a prize court preserves in maritime war that
taint of belligerent greed and of interested attack upon private
property which is against the spirit of modern warfare and which
has been declared illegal in land operations."<a name="FNanchor_14_318" id="FNanchor_14_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_318" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Though prize money as given in England was an institution of great
international importance in the balmy days of privateering
especially during the reign of Elizabeth when it was largely
responsible for the romantic careers of England's empire builders,
for the wholesale capture of Spanish galleons and for England's
naval supremacy, it does not seem to have been of any particular
importance to any one outside of the naval service of Great
Britain since the abolition of privateering. Practically it is
valueless. Theoretically it is bad. It should be abolished.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7_311" id="Footnote_7_311"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_311"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Among English Publicists favoring the abolition of the right
to capture private property at sea may be mentioned
Lawrence, Hall and Maine. The question came before the
house of commons by motion of Sir John Lubbock, March
22, 1878, but was negatived without division. (See
Phillimore, op. cit. iii, 361.) Lord Palmerstone once
said, "Question Statesmen, none will tell you that the
depredations of privateers have ever decided the success
or final result of a war." (See Political Science
Quarterly, 1905, xx, 711) and in a speech of 1856 he
hoped for the abolition of the right to capture private
property at sea. (See Speech by Rufus Choate, Second
Hague Conference, Acts and Documents, iii, 770.) Among
English publicists on the opposite side are Phillimore,
Westlake, T.C. Bowles, Twiss, Lorimer, Sir Shurston Baker,
and Norman Bentwich. John Stuart Mill in a letter to the
Times, March 11, 1871 spoke of abandonment of the right
to capture private property, as "the abandonment of our
chief defensive weapon&mdash;the right to attack an enemy in
his commerce." (See Phillimore, op. cit. 361.) However,
in a speech in 1867 he had apparently countenanced the
reform, (See Speech of Rufus Choate, Second Hague Conference
Acts and Documents, iii, 770.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_12_316" id="Footnote_12_316"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_316"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The French proposition was as follows: "Considering that,
as the law of nations still positively admits the
legality of the right of capture, applied to private
enemy property at sea, it is eminently desirable that,
until a binding agreement is established between states
on the subject of suppression, the exercise of it be
subordinated to certain modifications.
</p>
<p>
"Considering, that it is necessary to the above point
that, conforming to the modern conception of war that
it ought to be directed against states and not against
individuals, the right of capturing private property
apply only as a means of coercion practiced by a state
against a state;
</p>
<p>
"That in view of these ideas all the individual
benefit to the profit of agents of the state which
exercises the right of capture ought to be excluded and
that the loss suffered by individuals from the taking
of prize ought to be finally borne by the state to which
they belong;
</p>
<p>
"The French delegation has the honor of proposing to
the fourth commission that it express the wish that
states which exercise the right of capture appropriate
the portion of prizes given to the crews of the capturing
vessels and promulgate the necessary measures, so that the
loss, caused by the exercise of the right of capture,
will not rest entirely upon the individuals from whom the
wealth may have been captured."&mdash;This "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voeu</span>" known as
annexe 16 of the fourth commission appears in French
text in Second Hague Conference Acts and Documents, iii,
1148; English translation in Westlake, International Law,
ii, 313. For discussion of the measure see Second Hague
Conference, Acts and Documents, iii, 792, 809, 842, 845,

Although the United States has abolished prize
money, her delegates voted against the proposition
on this occasion on the grounds that it was a matter
for internal regulation, and that they did not wish
to take the emphasis from the broader project of
total abolition of the right to capture private
property which they advocated. Though England
abstained from voting, her delegate expressed
opposition to the "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voeu</span>" in debate.</p></div>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
